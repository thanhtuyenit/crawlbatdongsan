It is a sign of civilizational health to devote excess dollars to the scientific fringe, and to hope that bizarre secrets still await discovery even in our satellite-surveilled world. So good for Harry Reid and his little-green-men-obsessed billionaire pal for keeping the flame of weird curiosity alive.But I also doubt that such research will ever prove that the strange lights and vessels filmed by human pilots actually belong to a starfaring species that’s come to our planet to study, experiment and eventually offer us a hand up or else ruthlessly invade. Other sapient species may indeed be out there, but the most parsimonious explanation for all the U.F.O. encounters since Roswell is not that our nuclear testing or space program finally inspired the galaxy to come see what humanity is all about.Rather, it’s that our alien encounters, whether real or imaginary, are the same kind of thing as the fairy encounters of the human past — part of an enduring phenomenon whose interpretations shift but whose essentials are consistent, featuring the same abductions and flying crafts and lights and tricks with crops and animals and time and space, the same shape-shifting humanoids and sexual experiments and dangerous gifts and mysterious intentions.This was the argument of Jacques Vallée, a French-born scientist and a wonderful character in the annals of ufology, who wrote a wild book in the heady year of 1969 called “Passport to Magonia: From Folklore to Flying Saucers,” which The Times’s U.F.O.-spending scoop gave me an excuse to read.Vallée’s conclusion is basically the reverse of Erich von Däniken’s thesis in “Chariots of the Gods,” published to better sales the prior year. Where von Däniken argued that old myths and biblical tales alike contain evidence of ancient alien visitations (an idea picked up, most recently, by Ridley Scott’s “Alien” prequels), Vallée suggested that contemporary U.F.O. narratives are of piece with stories about Northern European fairies and their worldwide kith and kin — and that it’s more reasonable to think that we’re reading our space age preoccupations into a persistent phenomenon that might be much weirder than a simple visitation from the stars.This quasi-magical thesis made Vallée, as he put it, a “heretic among heretics” — the U.F.O. believer who rejected the U.F.O. community’s hope that their efforts could one day be incorporated into the normal sciences and lead us to some Spielbergian first contact. But his arguments for the basic continuity between folklore and flying saucers are quite compelling, and I suspect he’s correct about the commonality of these experiences …… Which is not, of course, to say that they reflect the genuine existence of some fifth-dimensional fairyland, from whence morally ambiguous beings emerge to play tricks upon our race. Certainly for most sensible secular scientific-minded people, to say that our era’s close encounters are of the same type as encounters with the unseelie court of faerie is to say that they are all equally imaginary, proceeding from internalized fancies and hallucinatory substances and late-night wrong turns, plus some common evolved subconscious that fears shape-shifting tricksters in modern Nevada no less than in the mists around Ben Bulben.But if this rationalist assumption seems natural these days, it is not necessarily permanent. The educated class of Victorian England went wild for fairies and spirits in the heyday of scientistic optimism, and both Vallée and von Däniken offered up their books amid the Age of Aquarius’s similar craze. (Just read Sally Quinn’s tales of murderous hexes in her recent memoir to recall how old-fashioned in their magical thinking the New Age’s devotees could become.)Sometimes our own elite opinion seems to be shopping for a new religion: I have read books in the last year pitching versions of Buddhism, pantheism and paganism to the post-Christian educated set. For such shoppers, the striking overlap between U.F.O.s and fairy stories might eventually become an advertisement for an updated spiritualist cosmology, not a strike against it — especially if woven together with multiverse and universe-as-simulation hypotheses that imply a kind of metaphysics of caprice.Meanwhile those of us who remain Christian — and yes, this is a Christmas column, U.F.O.s and all — can be agnostic about all these strange stories, not reflexively dismissive, since Christianity does not require that all paranormal experiences be either divinely sent or demonic or imaginary.Rather the Christian idea is that whatever capricious powers may exist, when the true God enters his creation, he does so honestly, straightforwardly, in a vulnerable and fully human form — and exposes himself publicly, whether in a crowded stable or on an execution hill. So the glamour of U.F.O.s, like the glamour of faerie, is an understandable object of curiosity but a dangerous object for any kind of faith. The only kind of God worth trusting is the kind who does not play tricks."

Turns Out He Wasn’t Alone.,2017-12-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/sunday-review/dad-believed-in-ufos-turns-out-he-wasnt-alone.html,The New York Times,"The year now ending has been so laden with tumultuous news that one astounding report in the exhausted final days of 2017 seemed almost routine: that for years, an intelligence official burrowed within the Pentagon warren was running a secret program to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects.Beg your pardon?That scoop, by Helene Cooper, Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie Kean for The New York Times, was underscored by a companion article that detailed how in 2004 an oval object played a game of aeronautic hide-and-seek off Southern California with two Navy fighter jets assigned to the aircraft carrier Nimitz. The object then zipped away at a speed so otherworldly that it left one of the Navy pilots later saying he felt “pretty weirded out” — as you might if you watch the video of the encounter that the Department of Defense has made public.In considering these reports, my mind turned to all those reasonable people who were dismissed and ridiculed over the years because they believed that something was out there. I thought in particular of believers who had died without savoring these official revelations.Believers like my late father.I can hear what he would have said, there at the veterans’ home, his broken vessel of a body in a wheelchair but his mind as quick and bright as a shooting star. “I’ve been saying it for years,” he’d assert, followed by a choice epithet he reserved for government officials, followed by, “I knew it.”Then, a satisfying drag on a cigarette.My father, Gene, finished high school at night and served three years in the Army; he did not attend college. But he had a fearsome intellect, read voraciously and developed a command of such subjects as American history, numismatics — and U.F.O. investigations. Through the 1960s and 1970s, he joined many others in monitoring reports of aerial anomalies, tracking down reams of redacted official reports and swapping theories about credible sightings and government cover-ups.They bandied about the names of well-known U.F.O. researchers — J. Allen Hynek, Donald Keyhoe, Stanton Friedman — and read the latest newsletters from an organization called the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, or Nicap. They remained resolute, even when many others gave up the cause after an Air Force-funded report in 1969 concluded that further study of U.F.O.s was unlikely to be of much scientific value, leading to the termination of the official Air Force program investigating the subject.To the likes of Gene Barry, the report was merely part of the cover-up.He was no astronomer or physicist. Just a working stiff who endured the anonymous drudgery of a daily commute but then, at night, often felt connected to something larger than himself, larger than all of us. While his neighbors focused on the fortunes of the New York Jets, he was contemplating whether the “wheel in the middle of a wheel” mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel referred to a flying object of some kind. If so, just consider the implications!In our family, the horizontal line separating earth and sky often blurred. My father’s supernaturally patient wife and four impressionable children carried small blue membership cards for a research and investigative organization called the Mutual U.F.O. Network, or Mufon. We applauded my father when he spoke at a U.F.O. symposium at a local university. At his behest, my sister Brenda even brought a blueprint for a spacecraft that he had received in the mail — mysterious packages often arrived in the mail — to Sts. Cyril and Methodius parochial school to ask her science teacher what he made of it.The teacher handed it back without a word.In other households of the 1960s, Barney and Betty referred only to the Rubbles of Bedrock, loyal neighbors of Fred and Wilma Flintstone. But in our home, those names might also refer to Betty and Barney Hill, a New Hampshire couple who claimed to have been abducted and examined by aliens in 1961.Then there were the family outings. Every so often our parents would pack us into the Chevy station wagon for a nighttime drive to that rare Long Island hill with an unimpeded view of the sky, or to Wanaque, N.J., 70 miles away, where strange lights were said to have been hovering over a local reservoir.Gradually, we children would doze off, our necks stiff from craning. My mother, the tolerant sidekick and chauffeur, would light another cigarette, while my father continued to train his cheap binoculars on the celestial infinity, confident in the certainty of the still uncertain.Over the years, life on terra firma intruded. Career setbacks, sickness, that daily anonymous grind. My father’s unofficial cell of believers quietly disbanded — exhausted, perhaps, by government silence and the false reports caused by weather balloons, satellites and people just seeing things. Then, when my mother died in 1999, he lost the person who grounded him, the Betty to his Barney.He died in 2008, still believing without having seen, still questioning the government, still marveling at the arrogance of those who insisted we were the only intelligent life in the universe.A decade passed, and then came this month’s report of a secret Pentagon program with the delightful name of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. Funded by the government between 2007 and 2012, the program investigated aerial threats that included “unidentified aerial phenomena,” or U.A.P.s — which is just a less-polarizing way of saying U.F.O.s.To hardened veterans of the U.F.O. wars, the news of the government program was less surprising than it was validating. And the video of the encounter between Navy fighter jets and an unidentified object moving at extraordinary velocity provided a helpful visual to the cause of those U.F.O. groups with long acronyms.“Very interesting, very interesting,” said Fran Ridge, the archivist of the research accumulated by Nicap, now defunct. “But the very first thing that entered my mind was — why now? Is this a distraction? Is this something to get the people’s attention off politics?”Mr. Ridge’s skeptical words reminded me of my father, who half-joked that he believed in a conspiracy — about everything.“Finally, the kimono is being opened a little,” said Jan Harzan, the director of Mufon. “Personally, I don’t need verification from the government. But for the mass public, it’s important to know that there is advanced technology in our skies.”The news of the Pentagon’s program received a stunning amount of attention that included the usual dismissive commentary.“Call me when you have a dinner invite from an alien,” the celebrated astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said on CNN, a comment that would have driven my father to distraction. Classic redirection, he would have railed, the tip of his cigarette reddening with rage.But my father would also have nodded in agreement to what the good astrophysicist had to say about that almost playful aerial anomaly captured on government video. “It’s a flying object and we don’t know what it is,” Dr. Tyson said. “I would hope somebody’s checking it out.”Exactly, the old man would have grunted. Been saying it for years.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the director of Mufon. It is Jan Harzan, not Harden."
5a4747dc7c459f246b63d441,"Pandas, U.F.O.s and Other Curiosities from Britain’s National Archives",2017-12-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/world/europe/britain-national-archives-panda-margaret-thatcher.html,The New York Times,"LONDON — The sporadic release of documents from Britain’s National Archives gives a glimpse into the country’s inner workings. For instance, there was the revelation that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher debated using the military to quell a miners’ strike in 1984.The archives are a repository of both the historical and the mundane, storing everything from Shakespeare’s will to countless government tweets.And then there are the more offbeat offerings: Britons learned on Friday, in the government’s latest release, about Mrs. Thatcher’s refusal to travel with a panda. Previous released included disclosures about leftover moon dust (found in a cupboard), a report concerning U.F.O.’s (there were none) and Princess Margaret’s hoped-for marriage (no government opposition).Here are some of the quirkiest revelations from recent years.“I’m not taking a panda with me,” Mrs. Thatcher scribbled on a memo about the financial struggles of London Zoo. “Pandas and politicians are not happy omens!”The note came after the president of the zoo, Lord Zuckerman, contacted Mrs. Thatcher through a cabinet minister with a plea for financial help. Lord Zuckerman proposed that Mrs. Thatcher take a panda “in the back of her Concorde” on her first visit with President Ronald Reagan.The trip would have been a chance for the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington to borrow London’s male panda to mate with its female panda. But Mrs. Thatcher was having none of it.When America’s Apollo 11 astronauts returned to Earth, they brought with them 48 pounds of rocks from the moon’s surface. President Richard M. Nixon presented Harold Wilson, the prime minister, with a sampling during a meeting in Washington in 1970.The four tiny pebbles mounted on an a commemorative wooden plaque first went on loan to the Science Museum in London, but as successive prime ministers struggled to find an appropriate spot to display it, the gift languished in a cupboard for years.Files from other departments, like the Ministry of Defense, provide interesting details about Britain’s security concerns through the past century, including those involving unidentified flying objects.The ministry received drawings, reports of sightings and questions from concerned citizens over several decades, papers released in several batches through the National Archives showed.“No U.F.O./flying saucer has landed in the vicinity of Menwith Hill and the base had no connection with U.F.O. research,” the ministry once replied to local farmers who reported sighting a disc-shaped object.The U.F.O. files are available for browsing on the National Archives website.Anthony Eden, who briefly served as prime minister in the 1950s, did not seem poised to stand in the way of a potential marriage between Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth II’s sister, and Group Capt. Peter Townsend. Even as the royal family was navigating what it would mean for Princess Margaret, then third in line for the throne, to wed Mr. Townsend, who was divorced, the government was coming up with plans to support the marriage.Mr. Eden’s government would have allowed Princess Margaret to keep her royal title.“The government was looking for ways of enabling her to marry,” an official at the National Archives told the BBC after government papers were released after the death of the princess.When Prime Minister Guy Mollet of France visited Britain during the Suez Crisis in 1956, he had a surprising suggestion, according to papers from the National Archives seen by the BBC in 2007. He proposed a union between the two countries.Later, when Mr. Eden was in Paris, Mr. Mollet reiterated the proposal and said that France would be happy to join the Commonwealth.The documents had been declassified years before, but, the BBC said, nobody noticed them until 2007.A suggestion to relocate Hong Kong residents after the territory’s return to China, in 1997, once inadvertently reached the Foreign Office.A Belfast newspaper published the proposal, by a lecturer in Northern Ireland, that the population be moved to a theoretical city-state to be created in Magilligan, between Coleraine and Londonderry. The piece provoked a flurry of correspondence between an official in Northern Ireland and one in Britain’s Foreign Office.But the Foreign Office official told the BBC it had been nothing more than a joke between colleagues.“Sadly, it’s impossible to make jokes like this any more,” the official, by then retired, told the BBC when the correspondence was revealed. “The Diplomatic Service has lost its sense of humor.”"

John Krasinski (“The Office”) directs and stars in this nail-biting horror movie in which a family lives in a post-apocalyptic town taken over by blind monsters who navigate by sound. The only way to survive is to keep quiet, which is easier said than done. Emily Blunt (Mr. Krasinski’s real-life wife), Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds put on impeccable performances — when Ms. Blunt falls with a loud bang, we fear for her life as we would for our own. In her review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis named the film a Critic’s Pick and wrote that Mr. Krasinski “directs with skill and restraint,” adding, “He knows that when the sound is turned down, we lean in, and he forces us to pay attention to facial expressions in a way that hearing audiences are rarely required to do.”ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS (1961) on iTunes, Amazon and FilmStruck. This debut feature by the French director Louis Malle follows Florence (Jeanne Moreau) and her lover, Julien (Maurice Ronet), whose plot to murder Florence’s husband goes awry when Julien gets stuck in an elevator. As he attempts to escape, he gets entangled with another crime when a young couple steal his car. All the while a clueless Florence roams the streets of Paris, convinced Julien abandoned her. If a black-and-white melodrama isn’t up your alley, enjoy the timeless score by Miles Davis.W. KAMAU BELL: PRIVATE SCHOOL NEGRO (2018) on Netflix. Like many stand-up comedians, the Emmy Award-winning comic W. Kamau Bell has plenty to say about the Trump administration. In his first Netflix special, Mr. Bell, the provocative host of “United Shades of America,” riffs on racism and explains how his daughters make sense of today’s political climate.THE ENDLESS (2018) on iTunes and Amazon. In this thriller, the directing duo Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson star as brothers (also named Aaron and Justin) who escaped a U.F.O. death cult a decade earlier. When they receive a cryptic message from a former cult member, the brothers return for a weekend to get closure. Inexplicable phenomena at the camp soon blur the lines between fantasy and reality. “The movie is shot in a realistic, grounded style that makes the unusual characterizations credible and the insane events convincing,” Glenn Kenny wrote for The Times in his review of this film, which he named a Critic’s Pick.CHOPPED 9 p.m. on Food Network. Martha Stewart joins the longtime judges Marc Murphy and Chris Santos in the season premiere of this cooking competition. With $10,000 on the line, four contestants prepare mouthwatering meals using surprise ingredients. This episode’s theme confines their big ideas to small plates."
5ab3e11c068401528a29b0c2,"Was a Tiny Mummy in the Atacama an Alien? No, but the Real Story Is Almost as Strange",2018-03-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/science/ata-mummy-alien-chile.html,The New York Times,"Nearly two decades ago, the rumors began: In the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, someone had discovered a tiny mummified alien.An amateur collector exploring a ghost town was said to have come across a white cloth in a leather pouch. Unwrapping it, he found a six-inch-long skeleton.Despite its size, the skeleton was remarkably complete. It even had hardened teeth. And yet there were striking anomalies: it had 10 ribs instead of the usual 12, giant eye sockets and a long skull that ended in a point.Ata, as the remains came to be known, ended up in a private collection, but the rumors continued, fueled in part by a U.F.O. documentary in 2013 that featured the skeleton. On Thursday, a team of scientists presented a very different explanation for Ata — one without aliens, but intriguing in its own way.Ata’s bones contain DNA that not only shows she was human, but that she belonged to the local population. What’s more, the researchers identified in her DNA a group of mutations in genes related to bone development.Some of these mutations might be responsible for the skeleton’s bizarre form, causing a hereditary disorder never before documented in humans.Antonio Salas Ellacuriaga, a geneticist at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain who was not involved in the new study, called it “a very beautiful example of how genomics can help to disentangle an anthropological and archaeological dilemma.”“DNA autopsies,” as Dr. Ellacuriaga calls them, could help shed light on medical disorders “by looking to the past to understand the present.”The research, published in the journal Genome Research, began in 2012, when Garry P. Nolan, an immunologist at Stanford University, got wind of the U.F.O. documentary, “Sirius,” while it was still in production.Dr. Nolan emailed the producers and offered to look for DNA in the mummy. The skeleton’s owner agreed to X-ray images as well as bone marrow samples taken from the ribs and right humerus.Once Dr. Nolan and his colleagues received the samples, they were able to retrieve fragments of DNA from bone marrow cells without much struggle. “We could tell this was human right away,” said Atul Butte, a computational biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author of the new study.The scientists eventually managed to reconstruct much of Ata’s genome. She was a girl, they found, most closely related to indigenous Chileans. But she also had a substantial amount of European ancestry.The scientists have not carried out any precise dating of the skeleton, so they can’t say exactly when Ata lived. But her European heritage suggested it was sometime after Chile was colonized in the 1500s.After death, DNA disintegrates into fragments, which become smaller over the centuries. Ata’s DNA fragments are still large, another clue that she’s less than 500 years old.While her elongated head was striking, it wasn’t the strangest feature of Ata’s skeleton. Despite being the size of a human fetus, about the length of a pen, her bones were as developed in some ways as those of a 6-year-old.Ralph S. Lachman, an expert on hereditary bone diseases at Stanford University, examined her X-rays. He concluded that her constellation of symptoms did not match any known disease. The scientists reasoned that Ata might have had mutations for a disorder that had never before been described.Sanchita Bhattacharya, a researcher in Dr. Butte’s lab, searched for mutations in Ata’s DNA and identified 2.7 million variants throughout the genome. She whittled this list to 54 rare mutations that could potentially shut down the gene in which they were located.“I was amazed by how much you can tell from the genetic blueprint,” said Ms. Bhattacharya.Many of those genes, it turned out, are involved in building skeletons. Some have already been linked to conditions ranging from scoliosis to dwarfism to having an abnormal number of ribs.But some of Ata’s mutations are new to science. It’s possible some caused her skeleton to mature quickly even while failing to grow to normal stature.Ms. Bhattacharya speculates that such a disorder would have caused the child to be stillborn. And she stressed that these mutations are, for now, only theoretical candidates.Other experts concurred. “There is no single slam-dunk finding that explains the bizarre appearance of this individual,” said Daniel G. MacArthur, a geneticist at the Broad Institute who was not involved in the study.Yet understanding what happened to Ata might shed light on skeletal deformities seen today. That may require engineering stem cells with each of the 54 mutations, growing them in a dish, and then looking for telling changes in their development.And Dr. Nolan has heard stories about similar skeletons in other parts of the world. If he were able to examine them, he might discover some of these mutations in their DNA, as well.Even more direct confirmation might be possible if researchers paid closer attention to stillbirths.Although there are 24,000 stillbirths in the United States alone each year, doctors generally don’t record the features of the fetuses, let alone study their DNA. With so little data, there’s no way to know if Ata was unique.“This could be a trigger to look into more such cases,” said Albert Zink, an anthropologist at the European Research Academy in Bolzano, Italy, who was not involved in the new study.While Dr. Nolan began the project as “a lark,” he believes the evidence now requires that the mummy be returned to Chile for proper treatment as human remains.“One has to respect these things,” he said."
5bac04cd068401528a2dd1d4,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,2018-09-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html,The New York Times,"Through Oct. 21. JTT, 191 Chrystie Street, Manhattan; 212-574-8152, jttnyc.com.Seven huge flatscreens at the center of this gallery, hanging side by side from the ceiling in a semicircle about waist-high, make up Glen Fogel’s new installation, “With You … Me,” at JTT. A white fluorescent tube on the back of each screen provides a skirt of glaring light to match the harsh glow under two benches facing the monitors. Playing simultaneously on all of them is a seven-channel, 13-minute mildly vertiginous video, taken with robotic, slowly turning cameras, showing the empty interior of Mr. Fogel’s childhood home in Denver shortly before its sale and demolition. Six graphite drawings on nearby walls, each titled “First Love as Drawn by Second Love” and executed by the artist Benjamin Kress, an ex of Mr. Fogel’s, reproduce photographs that Mr. Fogel took of his first boyfriend in high school.At first, despite its content, the formal details of this presentation combine to make it feel impersonal. The arrangement of the screens evokes some kind of surveillance rig on a U.F.O., and the drawings have the aggressive exactitude of a forensic report. Only when the video ends, and blackness drops across each screen like a closing eyelid, do the loss and alienation really sink in.These feelings are particular to the artist’s life, of course. But they’re also intrinsic to memory, to the passage of time, and to attempts, like this one, to communicate: Young love is irrecoverable, and however personal the recollections the artist may expose, there can never be any real contact between him and the viewer. WILL HEINRICHThrough Oct. 20. Ryan Lee, 515 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 212-397-0742, ryanleegallery.com.When you hear the term “indigenous woman,” you probably don’t think of a transgender fashionista posing with designer sunglasses and that opaque expression called resting bitch face. But that’s the image Martine Gutierrez presents, among others, in her clever and provocative exhibition “Indigenous Woman,” at Ryan Lee.Ms. Gutierrez created this body of work as a glossy art publication, which she styled specifically after Andy Warhol’s magazine, Interview, casting herself as editor and model. Presented as both large-scale prints and as a display of magazines lined up on shelves in the gallery, the photographs star Ms. Gutierrez, who’s often pictured with textiles bought from her father’s homeland, Guatemala. Alternating among vixen, earth mother and comedian, she hugs a brown male mannequin, sports melons as breasts, or sits among dolls and other trinkets, evoking fashion shoots in which models cavort with “natives” or animals in remote jungles or savannas.The work here also sits within the tradition of self-photography, with the artist assuming quasi-fictional roles or personas, a genre that includes Claude Cahun, Ana Mendieta, David Lamelas, Samuel Fosso, Yasumasa Morimura and Cindy Sherman, as well as Frida Kahlo, whose self-styling and elaborate costumes were as exotic to her Mexican neighbors as they were to Americans.Ms. Gutierrez contributes to the self-photography genre by reimagining — rebranding might be more accurate — indigenous identity. The “Indigenous Woman” here is no longer victim, subaltern, immigrant or refugee (although she might also be one of these), but powerful, hybrid, glamorous — even a bit scary. With her ancient Mayan roots and historical wisdom, she makes the devil who wears Prada look provincial and passé. MARTHA SCHWENDENERThrough Oct. 27. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street and 524 West 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-645-1701, jackshainman.com.One of the most eye-catching works in the Nigerian-American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola’s exhibition “When Legends Die,” at Jack Shainman Gallery, is the drawing “What Her Daughter Sees” (2018). It centers on a casually elegant young woman who sits, facing the viewer, in a plush dining room. She grips a teapot and looks into the distance with a tense expression. On the viewer’s side of the table are a cup and saucer, cut off by the drawing’s bottom edge.The work is beautifully executed: Its composition leads your eye around; the figures are vivid; and the colors are rich and textured, especially the brown of the woman’s skin, which has lighter passages that suggest the glitter of the sun on the sea. But what I love about it is its intimacy. The artist puts the audience in the mother’s place to witness a private exchange. Another example, “Objection to Bedtime” (2018), is a close-cropped portrait of a figure who seems suspended between boyhood and young adulthood; he lies down but expresses his displeasure with his eyes. That these moments and the spaces in which they occur are fictional only makes them more entrancing. Walking around in Ms. Ojih Odutola’s show feels like moving through a novel.The exhibition is the final installment of a project she began in 2016 that imagines two aristocratic Nigerian families joined by marriage. The drawings — in this case, combinations of pastel, charcoal and pencil on paper — are predominantly portraits of ruminating characters in domestic spaces. In a previous showing at the Whitney Museum, those spaces were often drawn with intriguingly skewed perspectives; here, they notably feature more portraits, including a 2016 drawing of the married couple. This show closes the loop on the project and affirms one of its apparent tenets: the potency of self-representation. JILLIAN STEINHAUER"
5a465cd37c459f246b63d309,U.F.O.s: Is This All There Is?,2017-12-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/science/ufos-aliens-space-travel.html,The New York Times,"Hey, Mr. Spaceman,Won’t you please take me along?I won’t do anything wrong.Hey, Mr. Spaceman,Won’t you please take me along for a ride?So sang the Byrds in 1966, after strange radio bursts from distant galaxies called quasars had excited people about the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence.I recalled those words recently when reading the account of a pair of Navy pilots who were outmaneuvered and outrun by a U.F.O. off the coast of San Diego back in 2004. Cmdr. David Fravor said later that he had no idea what he had seen.“But,” he added, “I want to fly one.”His story was part of a bundle of material released recently about a supersecret $22 million Pentagon project called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, aimed at investigating U.F.O.s. The project was officially killed in 2012, but now it’s being resurrected as a nonprofit organization.Disgruntled that the government wasn’t taking the possibility of alien visitors seriously, a group of former defense officials, aerospace engineers and other space fans have set up their own group, To the Stars Academy of Arts & Science. One of its founders is Tom DeLonge, a former punk musician, record producer and entrepreneur, who is also the head of the group’s entertainment division.For a minimum of $200, you can join and help finance their research into how U.F.O.s do whatever it is they do, as well as telepathy and “a point-to-point transportation craft that will erase the current travel limits of distance and time” by using a drive that “alters the space-time metric” — that is, a warp drive going faster than the speed of light, Einstein’s old cosmic speed limit.“We believe there are transformative discoveries within our reach that will revolutionize the human experience, but they can only be accomplished through the unrestricted support of breakthrough research, discovery and innovation,” says the group’s website.I’m not holding my breath waiting for progress on telepathy or warp drive, but I agree with at least one thing that one official with the group said. That was Steve Justice, a former engineer at Lockheed Martin’s famous Skunk Works, where advanced aircraft like the SR-71 high-altitude super-fast spy plane were designed.“How dare we think that the physics we have today is all that there is,” he said in an interview published recently in HuffPost.I could hardly agree more, having spent my professional life in the company of physicists and astronomers trying to poke out of the cocoon of present knowledge into the unknown, to overturn Einstein and what passes for contemporary science. Lately, they haven’t gotten anywhere.The last time physicists had to deal with faster-than-light travel was six years ago, when a group of Italy-based physicists announced that they had seen the subatomic particles known as neutrinos going faster than light. It turned out they had wired up their equipment wrong.So far Einstein is still the champ. But surely there is so much more to learn. A lot of surprises lie ahead, but many of the most popular ideas on how to transcend Einstein and his peers are on the verge of being ruled out. Transforming science is harder than it looks.While there is a lot we don’t know, there is also a lot we do know. We know how to turn on our computers and let gadgets in our pocket navigate the world. We know that when physical objects zig and zag through a medium like air, as U.F.O.s are said to do, they produce turbulence and shock waves. NASA engineers predicted to the minute when the Cassini spacecraft would dwindle to a wisp of smoke in Saturn’s atmosphere last fall.In moments like this, I take comfort in what the great Russian physicist and cosmologist Yakov Zeldovich, one of the fathers of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, once told me. “What science has already taken, it will not give back,” he said.Scientists are not the killjoys in all this.In the astronomical world, the border between science fact and science fiction can be very permeable, perhaps because many scientists grew up reading science fiction. And astronomers forever have their noses pressed up against the window of the unknown. They want to believe more than anybody, and I count myself among them.But they are also trained to look at nature with ruthless rigor and skepticism. For astronomers, the biggest problem with E.T. is not the occasional claim of a mysterious light in the sky, but the fact that we are not constantly overwhelmed with them.Half a century ago, the legendary physicist Enrico Fermi concluded from a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation that even without warp drive, a single civilization could visit and colonize all the planets in the galaxy in a fraction of the 10-billion-year age of the Milky Way.“Where are they?” he asked.Proponents of SETI, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, have been debating ever since. One answer I like is the “zoo hypothesis,” according to which we have been placed off-limits, a cosmic wildlife refuge.Another answer came from Jill Tarter, formerly the director of research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif. “We haven’t looked hard enough,” she said when I asked her recently.If there was an iPhone sitting under a rock on the Moon or Mars, for example, we would not have found it yet. Our own latest ideas for interstellar exploration involve launching probes the size of postage stamps to Alpha Centauri.In the next generation, they might be the size of mosquitoes. By contrast, the dreams of some U.F.O. enthusiasts are stuck in 1950s technology.Still, we keep trying.Last fall when a strange object — an interstellar asteroid now named Oumuamua — was found cruising through the solar system, astronomers’ thoughts raced to the Arthur C. Clarke novel “Rendezvous With Rama,” in which the object was an alien spaceship. Two groups have been monitoring Oumuamua for alien radio signals, so far to no avail.Meanwhile, some astronomers have speculated that the erratic dimming of a star known as “Boyajian’s star” or “Tabby’s star,” after the astronomer Tabetha Boyajian, could be caused by some gigantic construction project orbiting the star. So far that has not worked out, but none of the other explanations — dust or a fleet of comets — have, either.A pair of Harvard astronomers suggested last spring that mysterious sporadic flashes of energy known as fast radio bursts coming from far far away are alien transmitters powering interstellar spacecraft carrying light sails. “Science isn’t a matter of belief, it’s a matter of evidence,” the astronomer Avi Loeb said in a news release from Harvard. “Deciding what’s likely ahead of time limits the possibilities. It’s worth putting ideas out there and letting the data be the judge.”U.F.O. investigations are nothing new. The most famous was the Air Force’s Project Blue Book, which ran from 1952 to 1970 and examined more than 12,000 sightings.Most U.F.O. sightings turn out to be swamp gas and other atmospheric anomalies, Venus, weird reflections or just plain hoaxes. But there is a stubborn residue, a few percent that resist easy explication, including now Commander Fravor’s story. But that’s a far cry from proving they are alien or interstellar.I don’t know what to think about these stories, often told by sober, respected and professional observers — police officers, pilots, military officials — in indelible detail. I always wish I could have been there to see it for myself.Then I wonder how much good it would do to see it anyway.Recently I ran into my friend Mark Mitton, a professional magician, in a restaurant. He came over to the table and started doing tricks. At one point he fanned the card deck, asked my daughter to pick one, and then asked her to shuffle the deck, which she did expertly.Mr. Mitton grabbed the deck and sprayed the cards in the air. There was my daughter’s card stuck to a mirror about five feet away. How did it get there? Not by any new physics. Seeing didn’t really help.As modern psychology and neuroscience have established, the senses are an unreliable portal to reality, whatever that is.Something might be happening, but we don’t know what it is. E.T., if you’re reading this, I’m still waiting to take my ride."
5731bb2238f0d81c1525b6c6,Hillary Clinton Gives U.F.O. Buffs Hope She Will Open the X-Files,2016-05-10,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-aliens.html,The New York Times,"When Jimmy Kimmel asked Hillary Clinton in a  late-night TV interview about U.F.O.s, she quickly corrected his terminology.“You know, there’s a new name,” Mrs. Clinton said in the March appearance. “It’s unexplained aerial phenomenon,” she said. “U.A.P. That’s the latest nomenclature.”Known for her grasp of policy, Mrs. Clinton has spoken at length in her presidential campaign on topics as diverse as Alzheimer’s research and military tensions in the South China Sea. But it is her unusual knowledge about extraterrestrials that has struck a small but committed cohort of voters.Mrs. Clinton has vowed that barring any threats to national security, she would open up government files on the subject, a shift from President Obama, who typically dismisses the topic as a joke. Her position has elated U.F.O. enthusiasts, who have declared Mrs. Clinton the first “E.T. candidate.”“Hillary has embraced this issue with an absolutely unprecedented level of interest in American politics,” said  Joseph G. Buchman, who has spent decades calling for government transparency about extraterrestrials.Mrs. Clinton, a cautious candidate who often bemoans being the subject of Republican conspiracy theories, has shown surprising ease plunging into the discussion of the possibility of extraterrestrial beings.She has said in recent interviews that as president she would release information about Area 51, the remote Air Force base in Nevada believed by some to be a secret hub where the government stores classified information about aliens and U.F.O.s.In a radio interview last month, she said, “I want to open the files as much as we can.” Asked if she believed in U.F.O.s, Mrs. Clinton said: “I don’t know. I want to see what the information shows.” But she added, “There’s enough stories out there that I don’t think everybody is just sitting in their kitchen making them up.”When asked about extraterrestrials in an interview with The Conway Daily Sun in New Hampshire last year, Mrs. Clinton promised to “get to the bottom of it.”“I think we may have been” visited already, she said in the interview. “We don’t know for sure.”While Americans typically point to issues like the economy and terrorism as top priorities for the next president, a desire for answers about aliens has inspired a passionate bloc of voters, who make their voices heard on social media.Stephen Bassett, who lobbies the government on extraterrestrial issues, views a Clinton presidency as a chance to finally get the United States to disclose all it knows about life beyond Earth. Since November 2014, Mr. Bassett’s organization has sent roughly 2.5 million Twitter messages to presidential candidates, elected officials and the news media urging a serious discussion of the issue.“That was a storm, and now it’s like a steady drip,” Mr. Bassett said.The movement viewed Mrs. Clinton’s decision to correct Mr. Kimmel’s use of the term U.F.O., which some view as loaded and rooted more in science fiction than in science, as a breakthrough because it “suggested she’d been briefed by someone and is not just being flippant,” Mr. Buchman said.In fact, Mrs. Clinton had been briefed. She was prepped by her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, who is not only a well-respected Washington hand, having served as a top adviser to Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton, but also a  crusader for the disclosure of government information on unexplained phenomena that could prove the existence of intelligent life outside Earth.“The time to pull back the curtain on the topic is long overdue,” Mr. Podesta wrote in his foreword for the 2010 book “UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go on the Record,” by Leslie Kean, an investigative journalist.Mrs. Clinton’s position is not a political response to public sentiment — 63 percent of Americans do not believe in U.F.O.s, according to an Associated Press poll. But it reflects the decades of overlap between the rise to power of Bill and Hillary Clinton and popular culture’s obsession with the universe’s most mysterious questions.In 1996, Mrs. Clinton was ridiculed after Bob Woodward reported, in his book “The Choice,” that as first lady she had held discussions with her deceased role models, Eleanor Roosevelt and Mohandas K. Gandhi. The tabloid Weekly World News dreamed up sensational headlines about Mrs. Clinton’s adopting an alien baby and having a “U.F.O. love nest.”The Clinton presidency also coincided with the hit television series “The X-Files” and movies like “Independence Day,” which gave way to an era of fascination with the existence of aliens and the possibility of a government cover-up.Mr. Podesta, an “X-Files” fanatic, ran a fan club for the show in the Clinton White House. “The ‘X-Files’ fan club would like to invite you and Mulder to lunch at the White House. Don’t let the boss know,” he wrote in a 1998 email, referring to the show’s fictional F.B.I. agent Fox Mulder, according to White House documents. In 1999, Mr. Podesta had an “X-Files”-themed 50th birthday party that the Clintons attended.When Mr. Podesta left the White House last year, he posted on Twitter: “Finally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the U.F.O. files. #thetruthisstilloutthere.”Mr. Podesta declined to comment for this article.Mrs. Clinton, who speaks frequently about her childhood aspirations to be a NASA astronaut, has been sympathetic to Mr. Podesta’s efforts.In 1995, when she was photographed visiting Laurance S. Rockefeller, a billionaire philanthropist, in Jackson Hole, Wyo., she had tucked under her arm a copy of “Are We Alone?: Philosophical Implications of the Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life,” by Paul Davies.Before that meeting, John H. Gibbons, the former director of the White House Office’s of Science and Technology Policy, had warned Mrs. Clinton about Mr. Rockefeller, who had spent years pressuring the government to release files relating to a 1947 crash near Roswell, N.M., that had become the source of theories about a cover-up of an alien spaceship.He will “want to talk to you about his interest in extrasensory perception, paranormal phenomena and U.F.O.s,” Mr. Gibbons wrote.The meeting enthralled conspiracy theorists and, in turn, inspired Hollywood writers.“If you look at our mythology, there are elements of those kinds of meetings,” Chris Carter, the creator and executive producer of “The X-Files,’’ said in an interview. Mr. Carter, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, added, “If I have to become a fund-raiser to get an invite to her opening up the files, I’ll do it.”When Mrs. Clinton started to talk openly about U.F.O.s and government disclosure in her 2016 campaign, some activists traced the remarks back to the 1995 meeting with Mr. Rockefeller.To this subset of Americans who say the government is covering up what it knows about aliens, and who are incredibly vocal on social media, Mrs. Clinton’s discussion of extraterrestrials signaled an important turn.Other activists do not care as much about Mrs. Clinton’s vow to “open the files,” but do want prominent politicians to seriously acknowledge that humans may not be the only intelligent life in the universe. A major victory, some say, would be for the candidates to be asked about the topic in a presidential debate.“It shouldn’t be a source of embarrassment to discuss it,” said Christopher Mellon, a former intelligence official at the Defense Department and the Senate Intelligence Committee. “We should be humble in terms of recognizing the extreme limits of our own understanding of physics and the universe.”"
58fe29517c459f24986dbc84,"People Are Seeing U.F.O.s Everywhere, and This Book Proves It",2017-04-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/science/ufo-sightings-book.html,The New York Times,"SYRACUSE — Why have sightings of unidentified flying objects around the nation more than tripled since 2001? Why is July the busiest month for U.F.O. sightings? Why did they spike in Texas in 2008, or in New Mexico in September 2015?And how in the world, or out of it, has Manhattan racked up New York State’s second-highest tally of U.F.O. sightings in this century?These questions and many others emerge from the first comprehensive statistical summary of so-called close encounters: 121,036 eyewitness accounts, organized county by county in each state and the District of Columbia, from 2001 to 2015.The unlikely compendium, “U.F.O. Sightings Desk Reference,” is the work of a couple in Syracuse, who crunched unruly data on U.F.O. reports collected by two volunteer organizations: the Mutual U.F.O. Network, or Mufon, and the National U.F.O. Reporting Center, or Nuforc.It is the reference “U.F.O. researchers dreamed of having,” Gordon G. Spear, emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University in California, writes in the foreword.The book contains no narrative or anecdotal accounts, just 371 pages of charts and graphs that slice and dice the geography and timing of the incidents and the various shapes that witnesses reported: flying circles, spheres, triangles, discs, ovals, cigars.Many of the sightings turn out to be explainable, the authors say, but a small percentage defy resolution.The authors are Cheryl Costa, 65, a former military technician and aerospace analyst, and her wife, Linda Miller Costa, 62, a librarian at Le Moyne College and a former librarian at the National Academy of Sciences, NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency.Working on PCs amid sewing tables in the upstairs parlor — the warmest room in their hundred-year-old house — the two spent weekends for the last 16 months extrapolating figures from sightings reports and laying out the graphics.Cheryl Costa was writing New York Skies, a U.F.O. blog for The Syracuse New Times, when the Costas decided to expand their tallies of U.F.O. sightings nationwide. “We wanted to do our bit for disclosure,” she said. “It’s something the government should have been doing.”The Costas realize some might find this a strange way to spend weekends. But both say they have spotted U.F.O.s themselves and want to detoxify the subject.“We’re doing scientific research,” Cheryl Costa said. “What’s crazy is not being willing to look at research.”She came to the collaboration roundabout, having served as a cable lineman in the Air Force in Vietnam, and afterward in the Navy’s submarine service, as a man before undergoing gender-reassignment surgery in the 1980s. Ordained as a Buddhist nun, she was running a theater group in Maryland when she met Linda. They wed in 2011.U.F.O. trackers welcomed their publication.“With this compendium, Cheryl and Linda Costa have reminded the public and the media the extraterrestrial phenomenon continues unabated,” said Stephen Bassett, founder and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, which lobbies for disclosure of official U.F.O. records.Rebutting a common perception that U.F.O. sightings are on the wane, the Costas’ book shows that sightings have risen in waves, to 11,868 nationwide in 2015 from 3,479 in 2001. Only a small fraction of sightings are actually reported to Mufon or Nuforc.Their labor of love is about the numbers, just the numbers, and the Costas refrain from speculating on what exactly is happening. “We really don’t know,” Linda Costa said. “But all these people are seeing these things.”The government officially quit the U.F.O. business in 1968, with the finding in the Condon report from the University of Colorado that there was nothing significant to investigate, although some 30 percent of the incidents were unexplained.Mufon’s 500 volunteer investigators, however, continue to check out many of the sightings reported to the group. Roger Marsh, a Mufon spokesman, said that of the 270 cases his group investigated in Manhattan from 2002 through 2016, 44 eluded explanation and remained “unknown.”One of the most intriguing occurred on the afternoon of Sept. 17, 2011, when a man on the roof terrace of the New Museum on the Bowery photographed a fast-moving diamond-shaped object with windows and flashing blue and red lights against the TriBeCa skyline.According to Mufon, it resembled an unknown flying object photographed in Round Rock, Tex., two weeks earlier.The Costas listed 426 sightings in New York County from 2001 to 2015, second in the state’s tallies only to Suffolk County, on the tip of Long Island, with 554. How so many sightings in the nation’s densest core and around its toniest beach resorts have escaped wider notoriety is just part of the mystery.For the U.F.O. enthusiast, the pages of graphs and charts are a treasure trove of hard-to-find detail.The District of Columbia, with 9,856 people per square mile, had the fewest sightings: 154. (A political snub from deep space?) Wyoming, with 5.8 people per square mile, had more than twice as many: 337.Fireballs made up nearly 8 percent of the sightings in Indiana (230) and fewer than 5 percent in Colorado (157).California, the most populous state, led the nation in U.F.O. reports (15,836, more than the next two states, Florida and Texas, combined). Los Angeles County alone had more sightings than 40 states, followed by Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix.Population fails to explain the figures conclusively, the Costas said. Washington State, with 6.7 million people according to the 2010 census, ranks No. 4 in sightings, ahead of Pennsylvania, with 12.7 million people, and New York State, with 19 million.Rather, the Costas theorize, the figures may reflect good West Coast weather, which draws more people outside where they may spot U.F.O.s. Nationwide sightings peak in July, they found, and drop off between December and February.Still, in Mississippi, U.F.O. reports spike in January and November; in New Mexico, in September.The arduous breakdown by the nation’s more than 3,000 counties was notable for revealing clusters of sightings in remote regions, places where U.F.O.s are almost never mentioned. But every county in the United States appears to have seen at least one U.F.O.In the end, the Costas noted, the spikes may have a lot to do with media coverage."

Here’s the sign-up.)California gave rise to Silicon Valley, one of the most powerful and lucrative industries in world history. Now California is poised to rein it back in.This week’s cover story in The Times Magazine shows how an unlikely band of privacy activists took on Google, Facebook and other companies that mine personal data for profit. The group won a surprising victory in Big Tech’s backyard.Over two decades, Silicon Valley built a political machine that fended off virtually every effort to regulate how tech companies collect and use data. And when an Oakland real estate developer named Alastair Mactaggart decided to fund a privacy ballot initiative in California, he learned just how powerful that machine was.Mr. Mactaggart’s initiative proposed giving Californians more rights over their own data, with the power to demand that big companies stop selling and trading the information they collected about browsing habits and location.“I don’t want to kill businesses — I’m a businessman,” Mr. Mactaggart would say.His opponents turned out to be not just Big Tech and cable companies, who thought his proposal went too far, but some of California’s leading privacy watchdogs and consumer groups, who said his proposal didn’t go far enough.But Mr. Mactaggart’s ballot initiative forced historic compromise in Sacramento, driving lawmakers, activists and Silicon Valley’s giants to agree to tough new rules about privacy. Other states are likely to follow. And California’s law, which goes into effect in 2020, is now pushing Washington to look at privacy regulation anew.“Everyone who could have blocked it didn’t,” Mr. Mactaggart said. “When the system wants to work, it can.”(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)• Los Angeles will become the first U.S. city to screen metro passengers with body scanners for weapons and explosives.

5b530425068401528a2d020c,Suspicious Minds,2018-07-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/style/ancient-aliens.html,The New York Times,"PASADENA, Calif. — It was barely two hours into Day 1 of AlienCon and 500 years of accepted history and science were already being tossed out. Three thousand people had gathered inside the Civic Auditorium here for a panel discussion featuring presenters from “Ancient Aliens,” a History Channel documentary series.Everyone had questions: about whether we were alone in the universe; about what our government really knows; about humanity’s very origins.One of the network’s most popular and longest-running shows (Season 13 resumed on July 20), “Ancient Aliens” is itself a series of questions. Many are posed rhetorically by an unseen narrator intoning over a wide shot of a rubbly archaeological site. According to the show’s talking heads, extraterrestrials may have had a role not only in the extermination of the dinosaurs, but also in the construction of the Egyptian pyramids. Carl Sagan, the popular scientist who captivated television audiences of the 1970s and ’80s, once said: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” But Mr. Sagan has been dead for years, and many Americans of the internet age have been in a mood to challenge established ideas. There has been a resurgence of the flat-earth theory. More than a few believe that global warming is a hoax, that survivors of mass shootings are crisis actors. Yet for many at the conference, and elsewhere, this is not simply a political divide. We now know that the history that had been taught for years excluded the experiences of so many (African-Americans, women, the working poor). What else had been left out? Trust in the government and leaders who could set it all straight is historically low.And there are so many people ready to believe that aliens visited Earth before recorded history that some 10,000 attendees paid to visit this conference over three days.In the audience was Chris Bayley, a neatly dressed lawyer who had traveled from Arizona with his two adult sons. “Just because someone says the Egyptians made the temples with ropes and wooden rollers doesn’t make it true,” Mr. Bayley said. “We shouldn’t accept blindly things we’ve been taught by quote-unquote scientists.”Earlier that morning, a woman had risen from the crowd and told the “Ancient Aliens” producers: “I’m indoctrinating my children in your show so they’ll ask questions and not believe everything they’re told.”During the question-and-answer period, a wheelchair-bound man of about 60 was handed a microphone. He asked, “Do you believe we are indigenous to this planet?”It was Giorgio who answered him, naturally: Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, 44, the show’s breakout star, the one they’d most come to see and get their picture with. He was dressed as he would be all weekend, in the khaki shirt and pants and sturdy leather boots of a field archaeologist, though in the strict academic sense, he has no such accreditation. Before appearing on TV, he worked as a bodybuilding promoter while publishing “Legendary Times,” a newsletter about extraterrestrials. He is one of the show’s so-called Ancient Astronaut Theorists. It is not fancy credentials but the way he expresses gut beliefs that makes him compelling to viewers; that, and his hair. Perhaps no other figure in current American life besides the president is so vividly linked to a hairstyle. The do was as epic in person: a brown bushy bird’s nest sprayed up on all sides to achieve absurd height. It gave him a look of perpetual amazement, or of someone who had been electrocuted. The man in the wheelchair waited along with the crowd to hear if Earth was in fact our ancestral home. Behind the speakers’ table, Mr. Tsoukalos leaned in and, as he so often does on TV, made an incredible claim with total confidence and a goofy grin. “No.”“Exactly,” the man said, and practically dropped the mic. The primary pathway into “Ancient Aliens” and the ancient astronaut theory is a book called “Chariots of the Gods?” Rivaling “Led Zeppelin IV” as a mystical hippie-era artifact passed through the generations, it suggests that extraterrestrials gave technology and culture to the Egyptians, Mayans and other ancient civilizations — which sounds fringy, except it has sold more than seven million copies, with a 50th anniversary edition out from Berkley Books this summer. The 1970 documentary film of “Chariots” was nominated for an Academy Award. The book’s Swiss author, Erich von Däniken, flew 12 hours from Zurich with his ponytailed young assistant, Ramon, to speak at AlienCon. Eighty-three and slightly stooped, he still works every day, he told me backstage on Day 1, crisscrossing the globe “like a missionary.”With his severe Swiss-German accented English and tetchy impatience with critics, Mr. von Däniken is now, with the visibly amped Mr. Tsoukalos, one of the familiar personalities of “Ancient Aliens.” There is also George Noory, the genial mustachioed host of the late-night radio show “Coast to Coast AM;” Linda Moulton Howe, who once made a documentary suggesting that flesh wounds on some Alabama cattle were alien markings; Nick Pope, an ex-British Ministry of Defense official; and William Henry, a groovy “investigative mythologist.”David Hatcher Childress, who gets nearly as much screen time as Mr. Tsoukalos, is a real-life Indiana Jones who climbs megalithic ruins in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley equipped with a brown felt hat and a notebook. Since 1984, he has operated Adventures Unlimited Press, whose hundreds of paperback titles, several of which he has written, roughly chart the conspiracy du jour: Atlantis, Nikola Tesla, the Mayan calendar, recently Bigfoot. Before “Ancient Aliens,” these believers had been scattered on the margins, hawking their ideas at small gatherings in the Nevada desert. Now they’d been unified under one tent and given a podium by a network with the sheen of educational TV. Did that awesome responsibility temper them? Here’s Mr. Childress, in an episode from Season 10 called “The Alien Architects”: “So here we have an ancient grid structure, probably built by extraterrestrials, possibly to power their craft, that’s now being reconstructed today by the military.”Such broad, unverified claims are why “Ancient Aliens” is taken by some to be carnival entertainment (see the Viceland stoner spinoff  “Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch ‘Ancient Aliens’”) — and by others as something darker, a show that traffics in intellectual hucksterism and challenges facts. “The Idiocy, Fabrications and Lies of ‘Ancient Aliens,’” reads one headline from Smithsonian.com. Another critique, posted to Medium by Barry Vacker, a professor at Temple University, argued that since the Apollo 11 mission, Americans have lacked a popular narrative to explain the vast cosmos and our origins and destiny within it. “In ‘Ancient Aliens,’ we can see philosophy’s mediated corpse,” writes Mr. Vacker, who called the show “an attack on logic, rationality, and the nature of evidence.” For Kevin Burns, naysayers like Mr. Vacker add little to the discussion. A veteran TV producer who is often confused with the highbrow filmmaker Ken Burns (“I do the ones in color,” he likes to say), he was old enough to remember “Chariots of the Gods?” and to notice similarities with the 2008 movie “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which Lucasfilm hired him to promote with a TV special. Envisioning an updated “Chariots,” he approached the History Channel with the “Ancient Aliens” concept, which grew from a two-hour special into a series. Initially, Mr. Burns included skeptics on the show. But, he said, “we found that they had nothing to say, other than, ‘There’s no proof, there’s no proof.’ If we were going to do a show about the birth of Jesus, would we have people who say, ‘This is ridiculous?’ No.” The invocation of religion is deliberate. In Mr. Burns’s view, “Ancient Aliens” succeeds because it explores spirituality and the mystery of life in an increasingly secular, data-driven culture. Like religion, it offers seekers an origin story. “It’s not about little green men in outer space. That’s the three-headed snake lady that gets you into the tent,” Mr. Burns said. “It’s really a show about looking for God. Science would have you believe we are the result of nothing more than a chance assemblage of matter. The real truth is we don’t know.” The questions posed by the ancient astronaut theorists, however far-fetched, serve a rare purpose, according to Mr. Burns: “It allows the audience to wonder. And very few things on television do that.” In the “Marketplace” — the gymnasium-size room at AlienCon with the merch booths — the cast members existed comfortably with crystal jewelry sellers; practitioners of iridology and divine muscle testing; the author of a science-fiction series called “Gray Guardians”; the producers of the U.F.O. government cover-up thriller “The Phoenix Incident”; Sasquatch Syndicate, which sold Bigfoot action figures; a man and woman into cosplay who were both dressed like Giorgio; and the promoters of the Sedona Orgone Vortex, which promised to produce positive energy and block electromagnetic fields. On Day 1, a disheveled-looking Jack Nicholson was spotted checking out the offerings. Or was it an impostor? Another mystery. In the long line of fans who had paid $25 to get Giorgio’s autograph was Fabian Garcia, who had come with his daughter, Amanda, and young grandsons, Ashton and Cruz. Mr. Garcia said he wanted to get the full story from the “Ancient Aliens” producers and cast. “I want to go, ‘What else can’t you show?’” That a TV show that devoted an entire episode to how alien technology might have helped Hitler was in any way being censored was surprising to hear. But Mr. Garcia insisted, “I want to know more.” His grandsons just wanted to meet Giorgio, a cartoon explorer come to life. When Mr. Garcia babysits the boys, he watches “Ancient Aliens.” Now, he said, when he turns on the TV, Cruz, 6, tells him, “Go to the show with the guy with the crazy hair.” Mr. Burns went on stage and told the fans how he’d met Giorgio, then living near San Diego, and put him on TV. Believing the author of “Chariots” was dead, Mr. Burns had asked a staffer to find the modern-day version. This was for the “Indiana Jones” TV special in 2008. “I see this strange, tanned, young gentleman with poufy hair,” Mr. Burns recalled. “I said, ‘Who’s that?’ They said, ‘You wanted me to find the new von Däniken. That’s the guy.’ I said, ‘Bring him in.’”  Over dinner at a Greek cafe in Old Pasadena on the eve of the convention, Mr. Tsoukalos insisted he never intended to become a media personality. “I never sought out to be on TV,” he said. He was wearing what for him passed as a celebrity disguise: a hat. “It’s a totally weird experience.” As if to illustrate the point, a woman approached us on the patio and said, “Excuse me. I love the show,” then tried to palm him a $100 bill to buy his dinner. He politely declined. The next day, I watched him pose for photos for more than an hour with fans, including a feeble old woman who waited until the very end to speak to him. What she whispered to him wasn’t audible to me (and no one would tell me after), but the old woman began weeping. He bent down and comforted her. What did they see in him?“That’s one of the greatest mysteries I have yet to solve,” he said lightly. Mr. Burns told me that his star presenter was initially thrown by his sudden fame, and hurt and embarrassed by a widely circulated meme that sends up his enthusiasm for attributing seemingly any unexplained mystery, and some explained ones, to aliens (“I’m not saying it was aliens … but it was aliens”; “I don’t know. Therefore aliens.”). He felt, accurately, he was being mocked. A frequent criticism had it that he wasn’t qualified to appear on “Ancient Aliens.” Unfair, really, since M.I.T. isn’t giving out Ph.D.s in ancient astronaut theory. Mr. Tsoukalos discovered Mr. von Däniken’s books as a boy growing up in Switzerland, at 14 — the ideal indoctrination age, judging by the many convention-goers who said they’d also latched onto “Chariots” in junior high school. Later, he courted Mr. von Däniken as a mentor, and earned a degree in communications from Ithaca College. What was he if not a communicator? These days, he takes the jokes in stride (“It goes to show the appreciation for the show”) and views his celebrity as “a complete adventure.” A few years ago, he spoofed himself in a Taco Bell ad that aired during the Super Bowl. He will soon appear in a McDonald’s commercial. One sensed he was making decent bank in this field. He has become a co-executive producer of “Ancient Aliens” and travels far and wide filming the show. While he was doing the AlienCon panels, his wife, Krix Beeble, was doing a brisk business selling T-shirts bearing his face ($25), autographed photos ($25), the little gold spaceship pins that believers wear on their lapel as a Catholic might don a rosary. She designs the glass-bead necklaces ($275) her husband wears on TV, a nifty bit of cross-promotion. But does he really believe this stuff? “I don’t believe,” he said. “I know.” You couldn’t fake the fire in his eyes. Even before our moussaka arrived, he was lecturing me on prehistoric man’s contact with aliens: “They came down from the sky and said, ‘Oh, you don’t know how to make fire? Let us show you.’”But, he wanted New York Times readers to know, “I’m a skeptic. I don’t buy everything hook, line and sinker. There’s a lot of weird stuff out there, man.” He mentioned the flat-earth believers. “And then for people to argue, ‘Well, you believe in ancient astronauts so the flat earth isn’t too far-off.’ That’s what I have to deal with. It’s, like, the two are not even related! They’re not even in the same category!”He sipped his wine and with all seriousness said, “I’m a forensics guy. I need to touch, measure, feel and see things.” A few weeks before AlienCon, I drove to rural Connecticut to see Kenneth Feder, who has a Ph.D. in anthropology. We sat along the Farmington River, across the road from his modest house. In addition to teaching archaeology at Central Connecticut State University, he has a reputation as a debunker of what he called “pseudo-archaeology,” appearing on TV and has written a book, “Frauds, Myths and Mysteries,” which devotes a chapter to ancient astronaut theory. When I’d arrived, Mr. Feder, 65, had shown me his worn paperback of “Chariots of the Gods?” which he had read as a child of the ’60s along with occultish books on witchcraft and reincarnation. But in college, he said, he took classes with Pedro Armillas, a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican scholar, and moved away from mythology into the science camp. “A lot of the ancient alien stuff relies on willful ignorance and temporal chauvinism” — a disbelief that ancient people were capable of complex feats of engineering, Mr. Feder said. “I’d read that the building of the Mayan temples was a mystery and think, ‘Why don’t you ask Professor Armillas? He knows exactly how it was done.” Many of his colleagues in the academy thought it “better not to engage,” Mr. Feder said. “My feeling was it’s a big mistake to ignore this stuff.” The way Mr. von Däniken gathered evidence — “I look worldwide for facts and indications that prove my theory,” he told a Swiss newspaper — was the opposite of the scientific method. Mr. Feder wasn’t rooting against the ancient astronaut theorists finding hard proof. “If there was a crashed U.F.O. under the pyramids, I’d go, ‘Damn, that’s awesome.’” But, he added, “Science is all about evidence. The bar has to be higher than Giorgio walking around going, ‘How did they do that? The rocks are so heavy.’” The ancient astronaut theory was immune to facts, though. It couldn’t be stamped out with reasoning. You laid out the fallacies and people didn’t care. As far back as 1977, a joint BBC and PBS documentary discredited Mr. von Däniken’s thesis, with help from Mr. Sagan, showing how it “rests on inaccuracies, on unrelated facts and false similarities.” Confronted by the filmmakers, Mr. von Däniken admitted that a piece of evidence in “Chariots” — a photo purported to be a spaceship parking bay on the Nazca Plain in Peru — was “ridiculous.” As a writer, he said, sometimes he was “simply stimulating the reader, and one is allowed to do this.”Forty years on, the photo was still there in new printings of “Chariots,” uncorrected. At the same time, Ramon, the assistant, told me that there was more demand than ever for his boss to speak, that he was no longer ridiculed. “It’s getting better for him,” Ramon said. “Ancient Aliens” had its own vigorous rebuttals, including the documentary “Ancient Aliens Debunked,” a three-hour tour de force of critical reasoning undermined somewhat when people discovered the filmmaker was a Christian who believed in the truth of the story of Noah’s Ark. But in presenting an alternate view of history (“Our past is way different than what we’re being taught in school,” Mr. Tsoukalos told viewers in Season 1, Episode 1), “Ancient Aliens” had come to mean something for a population who felt duped by the so-called experts. Chris Bayley, the lawyer from Arizona, told me that although he’d been a good sheep in childhood, the truth was, even back then he had doubted the version of the world he was taught. “The show helped validate for me that suspicion,” he said. And so “Ancient Aliens” was filming new episodes; and Giorgio was starring in fast-food commercials; and amazingly, Mr. Burns said, reruns of old episodes did just as well in the ratings. During AlienCon, he and the organizers announced the conference would expand to the East Coast, to Baltimore this fall. The show had long ago run out of pyramids. It was getting further out in what it covered, mirroring modern life itself. Astronomers were discovering weekly new planets in the habitable zone, emboldening the ancient astronaut theorists. Last year, The New York Times ran a front-page story on a secret Pentagon U.F.O. program, which inspired a two-hour episode. The presenters were let loose to debate transhumanism, wormholes, God’s presence in sound waves, our brains connecting to a universal intelligence the way a smartphone links to Wi-Fi, our moon maybe a giant spacecraft for extraterrestrials to monitor us. All these creatively connected dots, these ever-expanding cottage theories discussed by the cast members, it was affecting them. “I’ve always been open-minded, clearly,” Mr. Tsoukalos said. But lately, he had become even more so; he had been considering “the nonphysical realm” — aliens as “something completely ethereal, beings of light.” Audiences were being radically opened, too. Something had come unanchored. It was inevitable where things were headed. The moment came at one of the “Ancient Aliens” cast panels, during questions from the audience. Everyone listened uncomfortably to a man who spoke at length, in an agitated voice, about certain flaws he’d discovered in the hard sciences. “Sir, sir, sir. Do you have a question?” Mr. Burns interrupted. The man exclaimed, “Why don’t you challenge physics and math?” I left the crowds and walked into Pasadena to get lunch. On the way back, I came upon a low-slung, ’70s-style office building made of tan-brown stucco, with a sign that read, intriguingly, “The Planetary Society,” in a swooshy font. I knocked on the glass door and a young volunteer, Sean, let me in. The nongovernmental, nonprofit organization was dedicated to exploring space and our place within the cosmos, Sean said. One of the founders was Mr. Sagan, who himself had a lifelong fascination with the question of extraterrestrial life. He lent a beautiful quote to the plaque outside, saying of humans on Earth, “We float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.” The Planetary Society was one block from AlienCon. But it was empty of visitors. Sean gave me a tour of the current exhibit, on solar sailing. A reflective sail is hoisted and the pressure from sunlight is harnessed to propel a small craft around the solar system, as wind moves a sailboat. One of the silvery Mylar LightSails hung from the ceiling. It was a wondrous, ingenious idea. It made me think of something Mr. Feder said during our conversation. I’d remarked that “Ancient Aliens” presented exciting ideas about our past. That’s why the show was popular. To which he had replied: “Isn’t it so much more exciting to believe that humans, through their ingenuity and creativity, built these great structures?” "
5a57736c7c459f29e79b36e1,"Fast Eddie Clarke, Motörhead Guitarist, Dies at 67",2018-01-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/obituaries/fast-eddie-clarke-dead.html,The New York Times,"LONDON — Fast Eddie Clarke, the quick-fingered hard-rock guitarist who was the last remaining member of the British band Motörhead’s best-known lineup, died on Wednesday night in a hospital here. He was 67.Todd Singerman, the band’s manager, confirmed the death in a telephone interview. The band released a statement on its Facebook page saying that the hospital had been treating Mr. Clarke for pneumonia.Mr. Clarke, who was born Edward Allan Clarke, joined the band as its guitarist in 1976, alongside the drummer Phil Taylor and the singer and bassist Ian Fraser Kilmister, known as Lemmy.Motörhead, known for its punishing and distorted heaviness, volume and penchant for rhythmic speed, which would inspire genres like thrash and speed metal, released 22 studio albums and went through numerous lineup changes. But the one with Mr. Clarke on guitar was regarded as the classic one, leading to some of the band’s best-selling albums, including “Motörhead” (1977), “Overkill” and “Bomber” (both 1979), and “Ace of Spades” (1980).Mr. Taylor, known among the Motörhead faithful as Philthy Animal, died in November 2015 at 61. Mr. Kilmister died a month later at 70.Mr. Clarke occasionally contributed vocals to the group, in addition to his chunky chords and squealing licks and solos. On “Beer Drinkers and Hellraisers,” a ZZ Top cover from a 1980 Motörhead EP, Mr. Clarke traded lines and harmonized with Mr. Kilmister, a strategy they would also employ on the band’s version of “I’m Your Witchdoctor” (originally performed by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers).“The best years of my life were in Motörhead,” Mr. Clarke said in a 2016 interview, “and what we did together I think still stands the test of time.”Mr. Clarke, who was born on Oct. 5, 1950, in Twickenham, a suburb of London, left the band while it was on tour in the United States after the release of “Iron Fist” in 1982. He went on to form the two-piece hard-rock group Fastway with the former U.F.O. bassist Pete Way in 1983.Fastway released seven albums, including its 1983 debut, called simply “Fastway,” which Mr. Clarke called a personal favorite. “I loved it because it was all my pent-up stuff,” he said. The album “All Fired Up” was released the next year, and the band would go on to tour with AC/DC.Mr. Clarke reunited intermittently over the years with Motörhead, including in 2000 at a 25th-anniversary concert at Brixton Academy in London. The show was documented on a live DVD titled “25 & Alive Boneshaker.”Phil Campbell, Motörhead’s guitarist from 1984 to 2015, said in a statement that Mr. Clarke would be remembered for his “iconic riffs” and that he had been a “true rock ’n’ roller.”There was no immediate word on survivors.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misspelled part of Mr. Clarke’s birth name. He was born Edward Allan Clarke, not Edward Allen Clark."

But the Party Must Go On.",2018-02-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-parties.html,The New York Times,"Philipp Plein’s rave on Saturday night, in a gargantuan Brooklyn Navy Yard hangar, was a Winter Olympics-meets-“Barbarella” extravaganza. There were rappers, drifts of artificial snow and a smoke-belching U.F.O. that descended from the ceiling.“I’ve partied here before,” said Joakim Noah, the New York Knicks center, who stripped to an undershirt in a V.I.P. area. “But I’ve never seen it like this.”Spectacle, arriviste or not, was a rarity this New York Fashion Week. Party heavyweights like Alexander Wang, Rihanna, Public School and Purple magazine were absent from the social calendar. Others found smaller confines: Opening Ceremony hosted a Barragán party at the Standard High Line, Garage magazine parked in the Gramercy Park Hotel’s Rose Bar, and Last magazine hermit-crabbed into a Brooklyn beer hall with Burberry.New York Fashion Week is both a corporate-fueled vehicle and a fractured vessel in a shifting industry. Brands are moving off-calendar, debuting lines on Instagram and decamping to European cities. Is the late-night scene slipping through the cracks?“You can’t have these giant parties and go back to something small,” said Paul Sevigny, the D.J. and impresario behind Paul’s Cocktail Lounge in TriBeCa, which will host an intimate event for Calvin Klein. “Fashion week used to be for people who were involved in fashion, not your Googles.”Mr. Wang’s show was also on Saturday. Instead of unfurling a #Wangfest with Kardashians, Cardi B and Dunkin’ Donut towers, as he did in September, he and his retinue ended up at the Brooklyn Bazaar in Greenpoint for a dance party hosted by the Lot Radio, an internet station that operates from a shipping container.There, Brian Procell, who runs a vintage boutique specializing in 1990s paraphernalia, suggested designers were rebelling against the fashion week grind. “It makes more sense not to follow these schedules,” he said. “Azzedine Alaïa was the first outlier for how people act now. Kanye is just going to do his thing when he’s ready.”Some parties were bolstered by ties to pop culture. On Monday, film and fashion gathered for a charity collection inspired by “Black Panther” at Industria in the West Village. Lupita Nyong’o, who stars in the movie, walked the red carpet; Heron Preston D.J.ed; and fashion designers unveiled their looks.Ruth Gruca, the global fashion director of Made, said it felt like a slow week, party-wise. “February fashion week is a little irrelevant,” she said, as she was leaving to check out the Barragán event nearby. “New York is kind of in fluctuation. A lot of brands are showing in Paris because that’s where the commerce happens.”Later, at Terminal 5 in Hell’s Kitchen, VFiles and Adidas Originals went experimental, marrying a live photo shoot with a party. As tunes from Lil Uzi Vert and Crime Mob blared, models sat for makeup on the stage and posed in front of white backdrops and lighting umbrellas.Nats Getty, a designer, activist and artist, praised the spontaneity of VFiles’ multidimensional format. “I love it,” she said. “It’s in the moment. That’s how everything should be. It’s genius.”The week’s most distinctly homegrown event took place on Friday, when the designer Telfar Clemens threw an after-party at Century 21, the discount department store in the financial district. Fashionable guests including Kelela, Maluca and Raul Zepol filled up several floors of the cleared-out store as drum-and-bass clattered.“l have a lot of roots here,” Mr. Clemens said. “I went to Pace University. I would come here in between classes to find everything designer that I couldn’t afford.”"

5ba457b3068401528a2dc237,Italy Loosens Vaccine Law Just as Children Return to School,2018-09-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/world/europe/italy-vaccines-five-star-movement.html,The New York Times,"ROME — For years, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement has spread confusion about vaccines.Its co-founder raised links between vaccines and autism. Its political leader campaigned against a law making vaccines obligatory. Its myriad websites drew traffic with posts by vaccine skeptics, and its party representatives blamed vaccines for tumors and allergies. For one senator, vaccine scars were “branding for beasts.”On Thursday, as school began this past week around Italy, the Five Star Movement and its coalition partner, the League, passed a measure that allows children to stay in school as long as their parents attest that they have been vaccinated, or will be by March. No doctor’s note is required.Critics consider the decree a dangerous, and purely political, measure that creates chaos in the school system, increases the risk to classmates with autoimmune deficiencies and tempts a public health crisis.Only a year ago, the number of measles cases in Italy climbed to 5,006 in 2017, from 843 in 2016. Last year, Italy had Europe’s third-highest per capita rate of measles after much-poorer Romania and Greece. Mexico has recommended that its citizens be vaccinated before traveling to Italy.Italy is perhaps the most acute case of a contagion of another kind spreading in Europe and the West — one in which populist politics, misinformation and psuedo-science on the internet have combined with an anti-establishment mood in which experts are not to be trusted.But now the populist forces that have fueled that trend hold power, and must deal with the consequences affecting the public health and security of citizens.“It’s all part of the anti-establishment drift,” said Beatrice Lorenzin, the health minister in the previous, center-left government and the namesake of the 2017 law making vaccines obligatory. “Because everything is a caste, also science becomes a caste. But science is the last bastion, when you have minimized the authority of science, there is nothing else.”Facing an increase in measles cases and a decade-long erosion of trust in vaccines, the prior Italian government required that children receive 10 vaccinations before enrolling in school. The law came into force this year.But this summer, Ms. Lorenzin’s successor in the new populist government, Giulia Grillo of the Five Star Movement, sought to loosen the requirements, at one point offering something she called “flexible obligation.” Ms. Grillo, who declined to comment for this article, finally settled on the extension for students without proof of vaccination.“Nothing has changed; it’s exactly like it was,” Rocco Casalino, the spokesman for the Five Star Movement, said after the law was approved on Thursday — raising the question of why, then, it was passed at all.On Thursday, Five Star senators said they would next seek to undo the vaccine law altogether.“Unfortunately, the state has diffused ambiguous information that can confuse the parents who are trying to decide whether or not to vaccinate their kids,” said Roberto Burioni, a leading immunologist at Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele and a bête noire of the anti-vaccine movement. (One mother posted a Facebook message saying she hoped he’d drowned on his summer vacation.)“The state should be clear, and be clearly on the part of science,” Mr. Burioni said.The measles vaccine, which over the past 50 years has helped eliminate the disease in the United States, was introduced in Italy in 1976. The percentage of coverage climbed steadily to more than 90 percent in 2003. But the obligation was eased in 1999, Ms. Lorenzin said, because Italy had mistakenly believed it had ingrained the belief in science and vaccines into the culture.Instead, she said, the opposite happened. She attributed the surge of distrust in vaccines to the fact that the diseases had become so rare as to seem unreal, to the debacle of a since-rejected and retracted report in the scientific journal The Lancet linking vaccines to autism, and to what she called “Doctor Google.”By 2015, coverage had declined to about 85 percent. Cases of measles, which can cause blindness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and in some cases death, have been rising.Italy’s “No-Vax” movement has risen, too. In Rimini, a hotbed of No-Vax activity and the site of a 2012 ruling by a local judge, later overturned, that linked autism to vaccines, anti-vaccination advocates attached streamers to planes that read, “Everyone to School. Freedom of Choice.”In Veneto, the governor, Luca Zaia of the League, has promoted a “personalized” approach to evaluating vaccinations. Families have organized a secluded “school in the woods” for unvaccinated children, while others have met in private homes.Ms. Lorenzin said that if she were still the health minister, she would send the police to break up the illegal schools. “It’s a chemical bomb,” she said.Mattia Marchi, a spokesman for the Veneto chapter of Corveleva, a No-Vax umbrella group, said parents skeptical of vaccines still had little choice but to vaccinate.“No one ever said that a vaccine causes autism,” Mr. Marchi said. “But if a thousand people see a U.F.O., do we want to tell these people that they are crazy or do we want to find a solution?”Last week, Federico Aliberti, an artisan, came from Livorno to Rome with his 3-year-old son to protest the required vaccination of all Italian nursery and school children.Mr. Aliberti, who voted for Five Star, said he resented the “arrogance” of scientists who presumed to understand something as complicated as the human immune system. His Facebook feed, he said, had been filled with clips of Five Star politicians promising personal choice, as well as articles and videos about the pharmaceutical interests behind vaccines and the vaccines’ supposed connections to cancers and autism.The government, he said, had given him hope but, even with the new measure, delivered only “a stab in the back.”Indeed, for years, the Five Star Movement, and more recently, the League, had given him something to believe in.Beppe Grillo, the co-founder of the Five Star Movement, has raised a link between vaccines and autism, suggested that vaccines weaken the immune systems of healthy children, and claimed that the pharmaceutical industry has pushed them for profit. Members of the party in the European Parliament have proposed eliminating some obligatory vaccinations for some public employees and professed a link between leukemia, tumors, allergies and autism to vaccinations.In another instance, they raised concerns that vaccines might be dangerous for possessing metals. The party’s mayor in Livorno called the obligation to vaccinate “intolerable,” while others in Puglia invited people to a hearing by doctors who believed eating nuts was more effective than vaccines in preventing illnesses.Last February, Paola Taverna, a prominent Five Star senator, fondly recalled “parading to her cousin’s” house to catch whatever disease was going around as a preferable option to vaccines, which she compared to “branding for beasts ” (This week, though, Ms. Taverna said she would have her own child vaccinated.)In July, a regional council member in the Five Star Movement from Lazio presented a proposal requiring students to go into quarantine for four to six weeks after receiving their vaccinations. The member, Davide Barillari, also called for an “informational” stage about the “causal correlations” between vaccines and pathologies for parents who sought vaccines in clinics. “Politics comes before science,” he said.Davide Casaleggio, the powerful son of the party’s other co-founder, who many believe controls the web platforms upon which the party functions, wrote on his blog that the Five Star Movement “totally distances itself” from Mr. Barillari’s statements.But Marco Canestrari, a former employee of Casaleggio Associates who left the company and the party and co-wrote a book, “Supernova,” about its inner workings, said that Mr. Casaleggio’s constellation of websites used to host articles “openly against vaccines.”“It was to draw traffic and advertising, on the theme of health,” he said. “There was a lot of consensus around it, but when the party got bigger and it became uncomfortable, they distanced themselves.”During the campaign, as the candidates raised questions about vaccines, the party’s leaders made sure to always say they were not against vaccines. They did so again after passing Thursday’s law.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League, Five Star’s coalition partner, apparently wanted to get in on the anti-vaccination action as he built his own populist movement.In March 2013, Mr. Salvini seemed unbothered about vaccines when he wrote on Twitter that his daughter Mirta had received her first vaccinations. “She laughed, mom was the most worried,” he wrote.Two years later, in October 2015, when he was still closer to the political margins, he seemed to test the political power of the issue. “Obligatory vaccinations, sanctions on the doctors who advise against it. What do you think?”Two years after that, in April 2017, he asked, “The first Italian doctor who says NO to vaccines has been expelled. What do you think?” Soon after he tweeted that he thought it was “mad” to impose so many vaccines. He insisted the choice should be left to parents.In subsequent Twitter posts he made it clear that he supported parents protesting in front of Rome’s parliament building, that he was always on the side of “freedom of choice,” and that he was suspicious of multinational corporations promoting vaccines.He also called for preventive pre-vaccine tests to ensure the vaccines would not harm the children.Such a test “doesn’t exist,” Ms. Lorenzin said. “It’s misinformation.”"
572b91d638f0d83ff98d7ca7,"Alligator Wrestling in Colorado? A Draw for Thrill Seekers, and Critics",2016-05-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/us/alligator-wrestling-in-colorado-a-draw-for-thrill-seekers-and-critics.html,The New York Times,"MOSCA, Colo. — Wes Arneson planted his bare feet in the mud and prepared for the fight of his life: a tussle with a 400-pound alligator called Big Bertha who lives in a geothermal swamp under a willow tree in high-desert Colorado.Bertha opened her jaw like a lion and let out a hiss like a snake. “Ride it like a cowboy,” someone yelled. Mr. Arneson hopped on.Residents call the San Luis Valley, a vast alpine desert in Southern Colorado, one of the weirdest patches of the West. Sparsely populated and largely free of light pollution, the valley lays claim to more than a dozen spiritual centers, a U.F.O. watchtower and a roadside attraction called the Colorado Gators Reptile Park.Here, the headline activity is the alligator wrestling course, a three-hour endeavor in which novices wrangle carnivorous reptiles with names like Pitbull, Darth Gator and Sir Chomps-a-lot. The cost: $100.Critics see the park as a dangerous, even cruel, gimmick contrived for adrenaline junkies raised on reality television. But to the people of San Luis Valley — which is isolated, agricultural and missing out on much of Colorado’s economic boom — homespun tourist attractions are a way of life.“In order to survive down here, you have to do something different,” said Judy Messoline, 71, who opened the U.F.O. watchtower down the road after her cattle operation failed. (In 16 years, she has had 30,000 visitors, she said, and 110 extraterrestrial sightings.)In an era of pricey tourist attractions with well-rehearsed routines, the gator park is defiantly do-it-yourself, with dirt roads, hand-painted signs, rusty pools and a disdain for safety measures like work boots and gloves. The park has no insurance, and a caution sign looms at the entrance: “Warning! Trespassers will be delicious.”“It’s an adventure,” said the park’s owner, Jay Young, 42, whose family moved here in 1974; they started a tilapia farm using thermal waters that flow beneath the landlocked valley, brought in alligators to aid in the cleanup and eventually converted the operation into a reptile menagerie.“It wouldn’t be fun,” he said, “if it was safe.”While alligator wrestling exists in swampy parts of the country like Florida, it is most often performed by professionals, and few places allow rookies to take part. Here, injuries are part of the package. “We’ve only lost one finger,” Mr. Young said. “Actually it wasn’t lost. I pried it out of the gator’s mouth and sent it to the hospital.”The gator park attracts people like sky divers and motorcycle racers looking for the next thrill — but Mr. Young also seems to have cornered a market few knew existed: people who use gator wrestling as therapy.Mr. Arneson, 52, is a tourist from Minnesota who works part time for a tribal school district. He suffers from chronic pain caused mostly by a car accident and said he was looking for a few minutes, or even seconds, when all he could think about was something else.He planned his trip around the class. “Freedom, that’s what this is about,” he said.He wore khaki shorts and a T-shirt to his lesson, and brought his girlfriend, Lorie Steinke, who mostly stood far back. In Pond 1, two employees taught Mr. Arneson and another student to pluck two-foot alligators from the water by the nape. The park’s turkeys cackled and a crew of emus looked on. “Toes sticking up make a good snack,” said an instructor, Drew Nelson, 36. “If you feel something you don’t like, be a tree.”Then they were on to Pond 2, which teemed with alligators measuring four to seven feet in length. Mr. Nelson ran in like a child at the shore, yanked an alligator named Kim Kardashian by the tail and, with a giant tug, jumped onto her back.Mr. Arneson, the student, went next.“This is the most dangerous-size alligator,” Mr. Nelson said. “They’re big enough to do some real damage, but small enough to move real fast.”The Young family first imported alligators from Florida in the 1980s, using them to consume tilapia waste. Soon, though, the reptiles proved more popular — and profitable — than the fish.The park opened in 1990 and grew to include pythons and hundreds of other pets whose owners had abandoned them. The wrestling course began in 2000.Staff members say the real purpose of the class is to pull the reptiles from the ponds to check them for wounds and apply antibiotics if necessary. Tourists are simply helping out. “We love alligators,” said Mr. Nelson, the instructor. “We’re looking for their injuries, not the glamour.”But a veterinarian with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals condemned the practice, saying alligators mostly like to be left alone. “We encourage anyone who cares about animals to stay far away from this place,” the veterinarian, Heather Rally, said.At the park, the class moved to Pond 3, the finale.Mr. Nelson ran into murky water carrying a green lasso. Neck deep, he hooked the rope around something heavy and then slowly emerged, dragging a 10-foot-3 alligator named Big Bertha by the neck.Bertha waggled and snapped. Mr. Arneson danced around the gator and then jumped onto its back, hooking his feet under her arms, his hands in her jaw crease.Two visitors from Denver stood by. “I think it’s mean, honestly,” said Chance Galindo, 43.Her travel partner agreed.“I’m kind of half hoping he’ll actually bite somebody,” said L.B. Templeton, 44. “Like bullfighting. You love it when the matador gets it.”In front of them, Mr. Arneson yanked Bertha’s head back, delivered a kiss to the snout, climbed off and watched her slither away. As a storm blew in, an instructor issued a word of advice. “Come on,” said Josh Stokely, 26. “Let’s get out of here while we’re still alive.”"
5644af1438f0d87765e9ff14,"Bright Lights, Strange Shapes and Talk of U.F.O.’s",2015-11-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/us/bright-lights-strange-shapes-and-talk-of-ufos.html,The New York Times,"When strange things appear in the sky, many people can’t help but turn their thoughts to extraterrestrials. But there’s usually a more down-to-earth explanation.That was the case when a bright light in the sky off the Southern California coast last weekend touched off a flurry of excitement about unidentified flying objects.After news reports, the Navy reluctantly confirmed it had been testing a Trident II (D5) missile fired from a submarine. A second and final missile was tested on Monday, The Los Angeles Times reported.It was one of several recent sightings in the sky to cause talk about U.F.O.s. Others included a group of strangely shaped clouds over Cape Town, also over the weekend, and an Army veteran’s claim that he spotted a “solid, dark-gray triangle-shaped craft” in the sky over Portland, Tenn., last week. Most of these sightings go unreported in the mainstream news media, though a variety of blogs and sites track them.“The mind abhors a vacuum of explanation,” said Michael Shermer, 61, the publisher of Skeptic magazine and a columnist for Scientific American. “Short of a good explanation, people just turn to the one that most immediately comes to mind which, in pop culture, is extraterrestrials.”A poll of a random sample of 1,114 American adults conducted by National Geographic in 2012 found that 77 percent believed “there are signs that aliens have visited Earth.” (It also found that President Obama would “handle an alien invasion” better than Mitt Romney, who was running for president at the time.)Another, more rigorous survey frome Time and CNN conducted in 2000 found that 20 percent of respondents said they knew someone who had seen a U.F.O.Peter Davenport, 67, is the director of a two-person organization called the National U.F.O. Reporting Center in Washington State. He compiles reports on sightings, like one in 2013 that came from a former astronaut, Byron Lichtenberg, who is based in North Texas.(Texas is a hotbed of U.F.O. sightings, including many that turn out to be the atmospheric phenomenon known as the Marfa Lights.)Mr. Lichtenberg confirmed that he did call in the report, though he pointed out by email that a few months after his sighting, details began to emerge about the Lockheed Martin SR-72 aircraft. “It would make sense if that’s what we saw,” he said.Mr. Davenport, of the reporting center, was dismissive of the idea that the naval exercise near Los Angeles should even be discussed in the same breath with possible alien sightings.“We’re struggling with a semantic issue here,” he told me. “The term U.F.O. from my vantage point alludes to a genuine alien craft that has exhibited flight characteristics that are altogether incompatible with terrestrial aircraft or any kind of object of terrestrial origin.”Mr. Davenport sent links to several reports of the kind of phenomena he was interested in, and described in detail the Phoenix Lights incident, playing a recording from a witness over the phone.Fife Symington, the former governor of Arizona, initially denied having seen the mysterious lights that floated over Phoenix in 1997. He eventually confirmed to various news organizations that he had seen them, calling them “otherworldly.”Mr. Davenport said that his principal responsibility was to avoid misleading people with data that had “nothing to do with the authentic U.F.O. cases.” But he said that many of the reports he receives are “from sincere and qualified witnesses that are seeing something that is dramatically bizarre.”The scene Mr. Davenport describes in Phoenix is an echo of several famous films about U.F.O.’s, like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” Steven Spielberg’s 1977 contribution to alien mythology. The cultural landscape has been saturated with stories about U.F.O.’s since the beginning of the Cold War and the “first stirrings of the space age,” as Mr. Shermer, the Skeptic publisher put it.The popular “X Files” series, due for a six-episode return in January, popularized the idea that the government was hiding secrets about alien technology. Many episodes of the show opened with the tagline, “The Truth Is Out There.”More likely, the truth is in our heads. Mr. Shermer, who is also the author of a book called “The Believing Brain,” is of the opinion that the possibility of alien life speaks to a spiritual need, calling it ”almost a replacement for mainstream religion.”“In a way, extraterrestrials are like deities for atheists,” he said. “They’re always described as these vastly superior, almost omnipotent beings coming down from on high, very much like the Christ story, the Mormon story or the Scientology story.”Although he is about as professional a skeptic as it is possible to be, Mr. Shermer said that he remained interested in the “supernatural, the paranormal, science and religion, God, extraterrestrials, U.F.O.’s, ESP.”He added, “It is all fascinating and, if it were true, it’d be fantastic.”"

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. A pivotal election in Turkey, a face-off in Europe over migration and the “world’s ugliest dog.” Here’s the latest:• President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey claimed victory in the country’s presidential and parliamentary elections.But an alliance of opposition parties immediately cried foul, warning its supporters that the numbers were being manipulated.It was the first vote to be held since Turkey approved a referendum last year giving the president sweeping executive authority. In this video, we look at a democracy on the brink._____• Europe at odds over migration. Germany and Italy battled over the E.U.’s migration policy at an emergency meeting of 16 bloc leaders on Sunday.The Italians want to abandon the principle that migrants must be returned for screening to the member country where they are first registered. But Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called for all bloc members to accept migrants. She is pushing for a solution that would thwart a challenge from her own interior minister over migration that threatens to topple her government.While the number of migrants flowing into Europe has dropped considerably, the politics of migration have become ever more toxic. For the second time this month, Italy and Malta barred a rescue ship packed with hundreds of migrants, above, from docking in their ports.Meanwhile, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women’s rights activist could not find a mosque where she felt at home in Berlin. So she started the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women are recognized as imams._____• “Brexit will be a disaster for this country.”Tens of thousands of Britons opposed to the country’s withdrawal from the E.U. protested in the streets of London, above, on the second anniversary of the Brexit referendum.Separately, the European aerospace giant Airbus delivered a stark ultimatum over Brexit, warning it could leave Britain if the country exits the bloc without a transition deal.And Britain’s Prince William landed in Jordan for a “historic” trip to the Middle East that will also take him to Israel and the Palestinian territories — places that Britain controlled for decades after World War I. He will juggle diplomatic and royal duties in a tense political climate._____• Beer, live music and (polite) debate.Denmark’s hottest political festival, Folkemodet, draws government leaders, C.E.O.s and ordinary Danes to a remote island where they hash out issues profound and personal.We joined the four-day gathering of 110,000 people, and found activists dressed in black niqabs protesting a recent push to ban the full Islamic veil, the chief of a scandal-hit bank in the hot seat for allowing Russian money laundering, and a Conservative Party tent with its own draft beer supply.“People wouldn’t come if it was only about politics,” one attendee said.• A high-stakes environmental mystery: What’s decimating the atmosphere’s protective ozone layer? An investigation by The Times and an independent environmental group found a culprit: Factories in China keep making and using an internationally banned chemical, mostly in producing foam insulation for refrigerators and buildings. Above, the city of Xingfu, where such production is common.• Italy is again struggling economically.

5ad3cb63068401528a2a8d2f,Creative Start,2018-04-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2018-04-16.html,The New York Times,"MONDAY PUZZLE — Happy Monday! This puzzle has a feature that teaches a good lesson in puzzle solving. You may, in your cruciverbal travels, rely on familiar paths when you slowly fill in a completely bonkers entry. A lot of letters just don’t go together, and their dissonance is a clue that you’ve made a misstep. A word beginning with FZG? Ending in GCU? That’s part of the process of elimination that helps you solve.But as you progress, you’ll find that constructors love a red herring — an unusual pairing or a triple combination that can make solvers scratch their heads or go astray. That’s because constructors are usually sadists, but I digress.Today’s theme pertains to a skinny little vowel that we all need to stand on our own, but isn’t in team, and hardly ever spends time in its own company, unless you’re talking about a Shinto religious gate or going on a lake vacation.To what could I be referring?There are four theme clues, at 17A, 24A, 37A and 52A, that have something in common. It’s hinted to at 62A, “Asset for a public speaker,” which, true enough, is EYE CONTACT.In other words, each of those theme answers contains the letters I and I together — in “contact.”The first theme clue I solved was 52A, “One teaching pizza slices and S-turns.” If you’ve never skied, a “pizza slice” is a cute euphemism for the triangle you form with your skis as you make a wedge. With the pointy side facing out like a “snowplow,” it allows you to slowly and gingerly travel down a slope with two narrow, slippery planks bolted to your feet. An “S-turn” similarly prevents you from gaining much momentum. You learn this from a SKI INSTRUCTOR.The top entry, which I surmised as soon as I knew the trick, is SUNNI ISLAM. I did not know that Sunni are the world’s largest religious denomination.Let’s look at 24A, which is a Times puzzle debut and a bit trickier, as there are probably somewhat fewer U.F.O. chasers than weekend skiers among us (but I assume!). An “Org. looking for aliens” has a clue within a clue. Since “Org.” is abbreviated, you can bet there’s going to be an abbreviation in the entry — everything in a clue is there for a reason. You may never have heard of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, but maybe the SETI INSTITUTE rings a bell, especially since we pretty much know now that we are so completely not alone.37A, “Supporting nativist policies,” is somewhat the opposite of 24A: Instead of looking for intelligent beings elsewhere, ANTI IMMIGRATION is barring them.15A: River trivia is a popular class at Crossword Construction University. The “Longest river in France” is the LOIRE, and it rolls through a valley that could be compared to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory, except for Epicureans and oenophiles. Sancerre, among other things, comes from there.22A: This sort of clue, “Inuit homes,” is designed to intimidate. Unless you feel certain of what an “Inuit” is, how can you know its domestic habits? Well, in order to be an entry, the home must be something distinctive — it wouldn’t just be a split-level ranch or a condo. If Inuit and Aleut ring a bell, they’re up in the Arctic Circle where IGLOOS get built. Historically, igloos existed in areas where permafrost meant there were no other building materials, like wood, accessible stones or sod blocks. And a house made of ice and snow would last for more than one season, if not years. Now that permafrost is receding, igloos could be going extinct.56A: “Make blue” could be “to dye” (you can make your own blue indigo dye — from plants! — in 235 easy steps) or to “give the blues” to, or SADDEN. We use colors to symbolize all kinds of emotions. Blue for depression predates blues music and could possibly refer to lore generalizing dye-makers; apparently the indigo dyers were melancholy, and the saffron dyers were choleric (or cowardly, as in yellow).The bookends of this puzzle at 1D and 60D are “Simpsons” characters, LISA and OTTO, although the clue for OTTO isn’t a “Simpsons” clue; it’s a pun I think the creators had in mind when naming the school bus driver (OTTO — AUTO — get it?). I thought I’d find some cute interactions between them on YouTube, but this takes the cake, and I can’t believe I’d never seen it. You have to wade through a couple of subplots but it’s worth it, I think:3D: “Became lenient” could be a positive, couldn’t it? The phrase makes me think of a Clint Eastwood plotline in which the flinty ex-cop’s heart melts after interacting with a plucky kid or a service dog. The entry here, WENT SOFT, comes off as kind of uncomplimentary, but maybe I’m thinking about it in the context of gaining marshmallowy winter weight, which never happens to me, but sounds like kind of a bummer.23D: A legitimate stumper sneaked in here! A “stabilizing part of a ship’s compass” who what where now? I’ve been around the block a few times here in puzzleland, and I got this entirely on the crosses; I’d never heard the term GIMBAL before, and it’s today’s ringer. I wouldn’t even recognize the thing that a gimbal is, honestly, but they’re being marketed as hand-held quasi-tripods for cellphones. Anything that replaces a selfie stick is my new favorite thing.26D: “Still uninformed” read funny to me; inert and ignorant? Nope. How about NO WISER, which means that after all of this, I remain in the dark.I think this theme is pretty self-explanatory, so I’ll give some insight into the editorial process from my perspective.The original version of this puzzle had YKK, the zipper maker, as an entry at 42 Down, which was deemed to be too challenging for a Monday. So, I was tasked with making some edits to that portion of the puzzle. They were accepted, but at some point, someone in the editorial process noticed an answer or a cross that they didn’t like, and so larger changes were made. In the end, almost a third of the fill was modified, including the middle horizontal third and the southeast corner. I hope you enjoyed the final product!Do the ayes still not have it?

5a9f72385d97b3000139403f,Discovering Art in and Around Maastricht,2018-03-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/discovering-art-in-and-around-maastricht.html,International New York Times,"AMSTERDAM — If you look at a map of Europe and imagine the Netherlands as a man’s smiling face gazing out toward the North Sea, the city of Maastricht would be, perhaps, a crumb stuck in the man’s scraggly beard. Brush it off in a westerly direction, and it’ll drop in Belgium. If the wind blows it to the east, it will likely arrive in Germany.There are lots of regulars and exhibitors to the annual Tefaf art fair in Maastricht who visit this lovely little city built on Roman ruins and gripe about the local offerings — the hotels aren’t terribly modern, it’s too remote from top European cities, the airports aren’t sufficiently near.But if you think of Maastricht as the nub of what is known as the Meuse-Rhine Euregion — which includes parts of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany; four official languages; five provinces; 10 cities; and 3.9 million inhabitants — you’ll start off with a better mind-set about the place.“From an outside perspective, even just coming from Amsterdam, the world kind of ends in Eindhoven,” said Marie-Claire Krell, a Maastricht-based artist. “But Aachen, Liège, Brussels are so much closer to here; even Cologne is just an hour away. We are sort of the center of the periphery.”Ms. Krell is also a project manager with Very Contemporary, a network of about a dozen art venues in the Euregion that has worked to “create a shared feeling of a common crossover culture” and offers bus tours and a map of all the art locations within a 45-minute drive from Maastricht. She said that there are plenty of art-related events for someone who craves a steady dose of culture. “It’s just exactly enough because there’s something you can do every day,” she said.During the Tefaf fair (March 8-18 this year) the local institutions are particularly active. Larger institutions, such as the Bonnefantenmuseum on the eastern bank of the Meuse River in Maastricht and the Ludwig Forum about 30 minutes away in Aachen, Germany, organize exhibitions, talks and other events to coincide with Tefaf.A tour of Maastricht’s art spots might start at the center of the periphery and work its way out to the circumference.The radial axis might begin within easy strolling distance from the MECC (where Tefaf takes place), at the Bonnefantenmuseum, with its signature building that seems to have a rocket ship at its center. Designed by the Italian architect Aldo Rossi, the museum is built in the heart of the former ceramics district and contains a vast collection of Dutch and Flemish old masters, but recent programming has enlivened the older work by presenting it “in dialogue” with contemporary art — often new commissions.While the permanent galleries have a particular focus on Early Italian and Netherlandish painting and 14th- to 16th-century medieval sculpture, during Tefaf, it hosts three semi-solo exhibitions called “Beating around the bush Episode #5: Old masters never die. Starring Edward Lipski, Johan Tahon, Helen Verhoeven,” the three artists on view.Also within the city of Maastricht, the Van Eyck Academy, a postgraduate institute that provides residencies for artists, designers, architects and curators, hosts Open Studio days for art lovers on March 9 and 10 (also by invitation on March 8), allowing visitors to glimpse projects the residents are busy with in the labs, gardens and gallery spaces.One of the more exciting new art locations in the region is SCHUNCK*, a multidisciplinary cultural center and architectural institute with a museum and collection of Dutch art, situated in a glass tower (the Glaspaleis) in Heerlen, about a 35-minute drive east of Maastricht. Until June 10, it’s exhibiting the “False Memory Archive,” an installation by the artist A.R. Hopwood, who has collaborated with Maastricht University to present art and a unique collection of lively personal memories that never took place, like a set of digitally manipulated photographs of U.F.O. sightings.SCHUNCK* is simultaneously presenting “Punk+Dans+Kunst: Angry movements,” an exhibition that takes as its starting point the 1986 punk ballet film “Hail the New Puritan,” a fictionalized documentary about Scottish dancer Michael Clark, directed by Charles Atlas. Karin Post, a guest curator and choreographer, creates a contemporary collage of responses to the movie, with images, sound and dance, until May 13.About 30 minutes northeast of Maastricht, in Sittard, another one of the more recent additions to the local scene, De Domijnen Museum, is also a mixed-use arts center with a library, cinema and contemporary art museum founded in 2015. It is known for its progressive exhibitions that explore realms of art and nature.Until April 1, true to form, it delivers “The Dutch Savannah: An exhibition about water, energy and the infrastructure of the cloud.” With contemporary art by the Irish artist Yuri Pattison and others, as well as lectures and research projects, the show reflects on the Netherlands role as one of the world’s largest global hubs for digital data traffic.Slightly farther afield is the more established Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst, in Aachen, one of the 26 international art institutions founded by the Germany private collectors Peter and Irene Ludwig (also of the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum and Couven Museum in Aachen and the Ludwig Museum in Cologne;), which includes works of American Pop Art, Photo Realism and European postwar art.Along with a continuing exhibition of local design products, the Ludwig Forum presents (until April 15) the exhibition “Digital Games: Art and Computer Games,” exploring the evolution of artistic modes of play and interactive art games that have been part of screen culture since the mid-1990s.The European Fine Art Foundation, which runs the annual Tefaf art fair in Maastricht, has in recent years been debating the idea of relocating to a larger city, such as Amsterdam or Rotterdam, but the board of trustees in December announced that it would instead make an official 10-year commitment to Maastricht.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Heerlen in the Netherlands. It is east of Maastricht, not northwest."

The operator of the center said it was not allowed to restrain children who want to leave, raising questions about who’s responsible for their safety.• Voters granted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vastly expanded authority over the legislature and judiciary on Sunday, with his conservative party and its allies winning about 53 percent of ballots.Mr. Erdogan has overseen a crackdown on lawyers, judges, civil servants and journalists after a failed coup two years ago. His critics had portrayed the election as their last chance to prevent Turkey from becoming an authoritarian state.• The victory could have grave consequences for NATO cooperation, security in Iraq and Syria, and immigration flows in Europe.• Dozens of people were killed in a chemical attack in Douma, Syria, in April — but to this day, Syrian officials claim it’s all a farce. The Times set out to investigate what happened.We analyzed more than 60 videos, as well as images broadcast by Russian TV. We also interviewed dozens of witnesses and experts to reconstruct a virtual crime scene, a single building that was hit by a chlorine bomb.• The evidence exposes Syrian and Russian lies. Our conclusion: President Bashar al-Assad used a chlorine bomb to attack his own people. Watch our video investigation here.• James Wolfe, 57, a former aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee, was arrested this month and charged with lying about his contact with journalists.One of those journalists was Ali Watkins, a 26-year-old who was hired by The Times in December to cover federal law enforcement, after the end of a three-year relationship with Mr. Wolfe. Her email and phone records have been seized by federal prosecutors as part of their investigation.• News of the affair  has stunned many journalists and set off an ethical debate in Washington.• Scientists say new production of a banned industrial chemical is damaging the ozone layer. Investigations by The Times and an independent environmental group led to factories in China.• Harley-Davidson said today that it would shift production of its motorcycles outside the U.S. to avoid European Union tariffs imposed as part of a widening trade dispute.• Uber is appealing a ban in London, its largest European market. The case this week is a major test of changes by the ride-hailing company and has ramifications far beyond the British capital.• The Supreme Court is expected to rule on public-sector union fees this week.

Our correspondent spoke with one female driver about her new freedom.• Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, was asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia, becoming the latest Trump administration official to be singled out in public for its policies. President Trump criticized the restaurant today.• The 49th annual Pride March in New York City offered a stage for the Democratic primary and its two rivals: Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon. It’s not clear that anyone noticed.• At the World Cup, Colombia and England won on Sunday, while Japan and Senegal tied. Today’s games begin at 10 a.m. Eastern, and we’ll have live scores and analysis.• “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” earned $150 million and the top spot at the North American box office in its debut weekend.• In memoriamDonald Hall, a former poet laureate of the U.S., found a universe of meaning in the apples, ox carts and ordinary folk of his beloved rural New England. He was 89.• Into the wild with Kanye WestIn the past two years, the rapper, producer and cultural fire starter has had wild stretches of public trauma, divisive flirtations with politics, and health struggles that played out both in public and in private.Speaking with one of our music critics at his resort in Wyoming, Kanye was measured and self-aware, willing to reckon with the challenges he’s created for himself.

This is his riposte: a chatty, informal memoir that covers his father’s killing when he was just 2, and the years of hardship he and his mother endured.”Did you see strange lights in the sky yesterday?If so, perhaps you spotted an extraterrestrial anniversary celebration! The modern era of ufology (yes, it’s a word) dawned 71 years ago on June 24.That’s when Kenneth Arnold, an Idaho businessman flying a private plane, saw nine disc-like objects zooming impossibly fast past Mount Rainier, in Washington. He told a newspaper, the East Oregonian, about his sighting, and it ran a short article that was picked up by The Associated Press.Since then, U.F.O. sightings have been reported worldwide, including in Australia, Canada, India and Scotland.June 24 was also the day, in 1997, the Air Force published a study about a second flying object report in 1947, by a rancher near Roswell, N.M., who found metallic debris scattered there. Rumors grew that an alien spacecraft had crashed. The study intended to debunk rumors about little green people once and for all (whether it succeeded is debatable).As for Mr. Arnold, stung at being mocked by skeptics, he once complained to an Air Force officer who interviewed him, “If I saw a 10-story building flying through the air I would never say a word about it.”But he never recanted his original story.Nancy Wartik wrote today’s Back Story._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

5ad85aa0068401528a2a9872,"At Basin and Range National Monument, Landscapes, Art and Aliens",2018-04-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/travel/basin-and-range-national-monument.html,The New York Times,"South of the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and the slot-obsessed zombies of the Sin City Strip, there’s a shopping mall that counts Whole Foods among its tenants. If you’re going to make the drive up the Great Basin Highway in hopes of finding Basin and Range National Monument — the whereabouts of which many locals seem utterly unfamiliar with — you’re going to want to stock up on food and water here, because you probably will (and probably should) get lost along the way.I steered my rented Nissan sedan onto northbound Interstate 15 on a mild day in November, eventually arriving at the juncture for the Great Basin Highway, which is signaled by a massive solar farm, its panels resembling a lake of tar. Past the red-rock canyons, craggy cactuses, stacks of boulders, and Lilliputian forests that populate the landscape, you’ll hit something resembling civilization in the tiny town of Alamo, which hosts a few motels, a cafe, a high school, a gas station-supermarket hybrid and not much else.Shortly thereafter, the highway juts east toward Caliente, marking the most picturesque portion of the drive. On this stretch, I encountered a pair of wild horses — dam and foal, presumably — and a disheveled man hauling a wheelbarrow full of possessions down the highway. He made no attempt to hitchhike or flag down help, and I questioned whether he was an apparition until I saw him again on the way back. By “way back,” I don’t mean on the way back from Basin and Range. I’d overshot my intended Mount Irish access point by about 45 minutes before a kind cashier at a service station near Panaca handed me a map. Basin and Range wasn’t on it, so I set out to find a towering silver alien in front of a Quonset hut on Nevada’s Extraterrestrial Highway, so named because of nearby Area 51.As an El Camino in need of a scrub fired up in a large, desolate parking lot, this sheet-metal symbol of galactic sentience stood in front of the Alien Research Center, a deceptively named retail shop that sells clothing, trinkets, U.F.O. publications and Alien Tequila, a brand the operation’s owner, George Harris, manufactures in Mexico. Manning the front desk was Harris’ brother, Malcolm. A welder by trade, he picks up work where he can and helps George out on weekends. I asked him how to access the grounds of the 704,000-acre national monument, which is roughly twice the size of Los Angeles. He told me I’m “about the second” person to ever make this request of him in the two years since President Obama signed an order protecting the land. Mr. Obama did so at the urging of the former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, a Democrat who represented Nevada, and in spite of vocal opposition from elected officials in Lincoln and Nye counties, where Basin and Range lies.Senator Reid was reportedly smitten with “City,” a huge geometric sculpture that the renowned landscape artist Michael Heizer has been constructing from materials mined on-site for the past 45 years, at an estimated cost of more than $25 million. While “City” sits on private land, it is within Basin and Range’s boundaries, and the federal designation was actively supported by Mr. Heizer’s benefactors. (They hope that the artwork will be viewable to the public by 2020.)In April, Basin and Range was among 27 national monuments that President Trump instructed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to consider shrinking to accommodate fossil-fuel speculation and other private endeavors. In early December, however, it was announced that Basin and Range — unlike similarly designated lands in Nevada and Utah — had been spared manipulation (for now, anyway). “Every acre of public land is vulnerable until Zinke’s out of the secretary’s chair,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Nevada state director for the Center for Biological Diversity.“This wilderness area, it’s always been a contentious point anyway, because Harry Reid was in on it, and nobody likes Harry Reid in rural Nevada,” Malcolm Harris explained. “I’ve never really seen any exploration out here for oil. I’m sure it’d bring jobs to the area, and that’s important. But it all depends on how they go about it. Most things I’ve seen like that, though, they leave quite a mess.”I followed Mr. Harris’ instructions a short distance up Highway 318 — the road to tiny Hiko, where a lake emerges like a mirage on the right of the highway — to a rusty metal fence. To it was affixed a Bureau of Land Management sticker which requested that I close the gate behind me once I’d driven in.Shortly into my slow, bumpy drive down a rocky road, I realized that I’d have been far better off renting a four-by-four. But the sedan made it through with nary a punctured tire, and there’s something perversely satisfying about taking an ill-equipped car into the sticks and returning it to an airport garage caked in dirt. Twenty minutes in, I pulled over to observe some Native American petroglyphs — manually maneuvered rock formations that typically contain a message. A B.L.M. sign in front of the petroglyphs read, “The precise purpose of these petroglyphs remains a mystery.”As I blazed my own trail on foot, I heard nothing, save for a few chatty insects and the wind. Beyond me was sky and rock and unkempt desert. I felt as small as a granule of sand, dwarfed by the natural world. Sinking into the earth seemed a real possibility, and a profound reminder that this ground was not meant for tires or sneakers, but for paws and hooves. It’s this sense of displacement that appeals to people like Jim Boone. A retired biologist and “grizzled old desert rat,” in Mr. Donnelly’s affectionate terming, Mr. Boone lives in Las Vegas, but makes the trek to Basin and Range regularly. “When national parks start getting too crowded, I start looking for other places,” Mr. Boone said, adding that he is “relieved” that Basin and Range will be left intact. “I like to feel out and alone and connected with nature.”Mr. Boone has been afforded a private tour of Mr. Heizer’s “City”-in-progress, an experience that changed his opinion of the artist’s quest. “I went into it kind of skeptical; I thought it was just some guy tearing up the desert,” he said. “But when I got there I was really impressed, and I understand the background remaining open is so important to it. When they open it, it will draw visitors from around the world.” Yet Mr. Donnelly dismisses the notion that “City” had anything to do with the monument avoiding Mr. Zinke’s X-acto knife.“It certainly helped to rally support for monument consideration,” Mr. Donnelly said. “But do you think public landscape art is a factor for the Trump Administration? If anything, that would motivate them to deregulate [the land] to piss off the liberals.”When “City” is finally opened to the public, it could fulfill Mr. Boone’s prophecy as a magnet for travelers. This may diminish the sense of tranquil isolation felt by previous visitors like Mr. Boone, for whom pragmatism and a willingness to venture further reign supreme.“Visitation will probably just be on one road,” he said of Mr. Heizer’s future exhibit. Basin and Range “will remain big and open. But if that’s not the case, I’ll go further out to somewhere that’s more wild.”"
5a4f573f7c459f29e79b26e6,How to Counter the Circus of Pseudoscience,2018-01-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/opinion/doctors-naturopaths-health-science.html,International New York Times,"Maybe one day, once I have decades of experience as a doctor and further training in my area of specialization, I will be able to speak about health matters with the tone of authority of the average naturopath.That was the thought that crossed my mind recently while I waded through the online world of alternative-health practitioners, wellness bloggers, whole-food chefs and Gwyneth Paltrow.I did not seek it out at first; it came to me through a social-media algorithm. Facebook offered up a video advertisement from a “female hormonal health specialist” with her own “practice.” Not an endocrinologist but a naturopath. She lectured with confidence on thyroid testing, though much of what she said was wrong. And down the internet rabbit hole I went.One traditional view of the medical profession is that doctors are commanding and authoritarian, even arrogant. Though some individuals fit that description, in fact, the profession is built on doubt.Most doctors, especially the good ones, are acutely aware of the limits of their knowledge. I have learned from those much more experienced and qualified than me that humility is something to be cultivated over time, not lost.Our field is built around trying to prove ourselves wrong. In hospitals we hold morbidity and mortality meetings trying to show where we have failed, what we need to change, how we can do better. Our hospital work is audited to identify where we fell short of our ideals. Through scientific research we try to disprove the effectiveness of treatments. Our failings are exposed from the inside.The nature of evidence-based health care is that practices change as new evidence emerges.That is also the case for other health professionals whose practice is based on science, like qualified dietitians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists. Guidelines are revised, advice is reversed — on blood pressure, diet, hormone replacement, opioid prescribing. This can be immensely frustrating for patients, even though it is what we must do to provide the best possible treatment.In the face of such doubt, it is not surprising that some individuals, even those who are intelligent and well educated, are swept away by the breezy confidence of health gurus, who are full of passionate intensity while the qualified lack all conviction, to borrow from Yeats.It is a cognitive bias known in psychology as the Dunning-Kruger Effect. In short, the less you know, the less able you are to recognize how little you know, so the less likely you are to recognize your errors and shortcomings. For the highly skilled, like trained scientists, the opposite is true: The more you know, the more likely you are to see how little you know. This is truly a cognitive bias for our time.This may explain how an Australian celebrity chef named Pete Evans cannot only promote the health benefits of a Paleo diet but also feel knowledgeable enough to make pronouncements on fluoride, sunscreen and vaccinations. He responded to criticisms in a television interview by saying: “What do you need a qualification for? To talk common sense?” He added, “Why do you have to study something that is outdated, that is industry backed, that is biased, that is not getting the results?”Engaging is difficult when the alternative-health proponents are on such a different astral plane that it is a challenge even to find common language for a conversation, especially when they promote spurious concepts such as “pyrrole disease,” which they can speak about in great, false detail, drawing the well-informed physician, dietitian or scientist into a vortex of personal anecdote and ancient wisdom, with quips about big pharma thrown in for good measure.It is kind of like an aerodynamics engineer trying to argue about alien spacecraft with the founder of a U.F.O. museum. How can an aerodynamics engineer speak with authority on the matter when he or she has not even bothered to research the events at Roswell and is not even aware that there are alien dissection videos freely available on the internet?Countering the online health gurus is especially difficult when they offer the irresistible cocktail of medical language muddled with a much more pleasing aesthetic than medicine, far from the clinical world of linoleum and antiseptic, a better place where patients’ conditions are diagnosed with metaphors (“adrenal fatigue”) and treated with poetry (holy basil, bone broth, Himalayan sea salt).Just like that naturopath on Facebook describing herself as a “specialist” with a “practice,” alternative-health gurus harness the language of medicine to seem authoritative. They order investigations, adopt protocols. And of course what they say is always half right, which is how pseudoscience works.But it is not the vocabulary of science that is important — it is the methodology. It would be much better if they left the language and took the rigorous approach to evidence instead, which might mean, for example, Goop choosing not to sell an $84 water bottle with amethyst quartz to “infuse water with positive energy.”In the face of this circus, we doctors must hold tight to evidence. We must hold tight to our doubt, our knowledge of our fallibility as individuals and as a profession, knowing that humility is a strength, not a weakness.But we must also as a profession engage in the public conversations about health, including on social media, along with our colleagues in allied health fields. If we do not, the discussion will be dominated by the passionately uninformed, who build trust only to sell false cures. And we must listen to patients, as we are taught to do, showing care and understanding. We must take on the difficult challenge of inspiring and motivating with the truth."
5a6b428d10f40f00018bde87,This Horror Movie Is Based on a True Story. Sort Of.,2018-01-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/movies/horror-movie-based-on-a-true-story.html,The New York Times,"The Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, Calif., is incredibly whimsical or intensely eerie, depending on how you view such things, with stairs leading to the ceiling and doors that open to nowhere. The grand estate was the home of Sarah Winchester, heiress to the Winchester Repeating Arms fortune, who, according to legend, had workers ceaselessly laboring on the house for decades, from 1884 until her death in 1922. She undertook the project at the behest of a New England seer to delay her own demise, one version of the story goes, or to calm the spirits of the thousands of souls killed throughout the ages by Winchester rifles, as another version has it.The tale has all the makings of a good horror flick: a mysterious medium; a weird, possibly haunted house; a reclusive heiress who may or may not have been insane; ghosts. Best of all, the story is true — or is it?In “Winchester,” which opens Friday, Feb. 2, the directors Peter and Michael Spierig (“Predestination,” “Jigsaw”) have taken the Northern California tale at its spooky word, filling the mansion with levitating rifles, rocking chairs that move by themselves, and the specters of an army of long-dead war veterans and murder victims. Then there’s Helen Mirren, dressed head to toe in mourning black, as the mysterious Ms. Winchester. Cue the fin de siècle jump scare.Studio marketers are playing up the “true story” angle on trailers and posters and news releases, hoping to make the already scary story even more so. But the studio also added the label because it couldn’t assume that people outside Northern California would have even heard of Sarah Winchester and her house.“Winchester” is the latest in a grand line of horror films to trade on its supposed veracity. “Based on a true story,” the trailers to these films trumpet, or “inspired by actual events.” The 1979 “The Amityville Horror” was based on a supposed haunting from 1975 (“You will believe,” the trailer intoned). The macabre exploits of Ed Gein, the Wisconsin murderer who fashioned furniture and clothing out of human body parts, inspired films from“Psycho” to “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre” (“What happened is true,” one film poster read) to “The Silence of the Lambs.”And the practice shows no sign of abating. Last year, there were “Amityville: The Awakening” (“inspired by true events”), the 18th in the series, and the U.F.O. thriller “Phoenix Forgotten” (“based on shocking untold true events”); “Conjuring 3” is still to come. But these are horror films. Do we need them to be authentic as well?“If you can establish that there’s a true story, or that there are factual elements being woven into the story, then you’ve taken a big step in inducing a creepy mood in your audience,” said Stephen Prince, a cinema studies professor at Virginia Tech and editor of “The Horror Film,” a collection of essays about the genre.But how true to life can a horror film be, particularly ones, like “Winchester,” that are filled with spirits and apparitions? And who would believe these claims in the first place?“The audience for horror films is a very self-selected audience, in a way that’s not true for a lot of other genres,” Mr. Prince said. “People who go to these films are ready to believe.”Interestingly enough, the “true story” of Sarah Winchester, the one that keeps crowds flocking to the San Jose tourist attraction, was in doubt long before the Spierig brothers had their go at it. Sure, there was a real Sarah Winchester, and she did build a house in San Jose, but much of what people think they know about the woman and her house involves spook stories cooked up by journalists of her day, said the Winchester biographer Mary Jo Ignoffo, author of “Captive of the Labyrinth: Sarah L. Winchester, Heiress to the Rifle Fortune.”The stairs to the ceiling and the doors that lead nowhere? The result of earthquake damage left unrepaired after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. All those rooms? A reflection of Ms. Winchester’s interest in architecture and interior design — she came from a long line of woodworkers — not her belief in spiritualists or the supernatural. Her supposed “gun guilt”?“There’s no evidence for that,” Ms. Ignoffo said. “Nobody felt guilty about guns at the turn of the 20th century. Everybody used them and needed them.”“The fundamental lie is that the building of the house went on 24/7,” Ms. Ignoffo continued. “She didn’t even live in the house for the last 15 years of her life.”None of which will lessen a viewer’s enjoyment of the film — nor should it, particularly when it comes to horror movies. “I think with horror, ‘based on a true story’ is much more loosely applied,” said Jonathan Vankin, author of “Based on a True Story: Fact and Fantasy in 100 Favorite Movies.”And with horror films about ghosts and paranormal sightings, you’re often getting what people say they saw, amplified by all the appropriate special effects. “So there are really two levels of reality there,” he said. “It becomes very meta. So yes, it’s a ‘true story,’ but maybe one with an unreliable narrator.”Even so, the filmmakers read all they could about the house and its owner, consulted historical documents and period photographs, and visited the home five times. (While exterior shots were filmed in San Jose, much of the film was shot on a set in Australia, where the directors are based.) Among the completely true elements included in the film are the home’s weird switchback staircase and the very unspooky reason for it. Ms. Winchester had rheumatoid arthritis, and the low-stepped stairs functioned as something of a ramp.While the film and the biography couldn’t be less alike, both reach similar conclusions about Ms. Winchester: She was considerably more heroic, and considerably less nuts, than she has sometimes been painted. In Ms. Ignoffo’s book, Ms. Winchester is a savvy businesswoman; a beloved employer; and a generous sister, aunt and philanthropist. In “Winchester,” she’s a tough heroine out to protect her family and home from evil spirits and greedy company executives alike.If the film often strays from the truth for the sake of a good scare — there’s no record that Ms. Winchester was ever attacked by a boy possessed by the ghost of a murderous Confederate soldier, for example — that’s fine with its creators. “Ultimately you’re not making a documentary,” Michael Spierig said. “You’re making a piece of entertainment.”"
5a656ffe10f40f00018bd245,"Marfa Road Trip: Thelma and Louise, With a Happier Ending ",2018-01-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/travel/marfa-texas-road-trip.html,The New York Times,"When you escape your life at 45, as in a Thelma and Louise-level escape, you go to the desert. My best friends of 25 years joined me. We were all leaving behind something. Beth and Miriam were leaving their young children behind. Sara had just recovered from breast cancer; her mastectomy was fresh, just under a year. I was taking a break from kids, my husband and my 80-pound incessantly barking dog.We picked Marfa, the artist hub in the middle of the West Texas desert as the destination of our road trip last winter. We had been traveling together for 15 years. The quirky art community was part of the reason we landed on Marfa. We wanted to fade into the weirdness of the town, with our identities washing away into the artist Donald Judd’s concrete blocks, the dry landscape and the big sky. We knew it would be the kind of place you might forget to call your family. (Indeed, it was.)If we were lucky, we’d get some much needed refueling, maybe a chance to scream in the middle of the road, or, like Thelma and Louise, innocently flirt with a Brad Pitt type of cowboy. And even though GPS would never allow any of us to get lost, we longed for that feeling of disappearing. Just temporarily.Beth and Miriam drove from Austin. I flew from New Jersey into El Paso to meet Sara, who came in from Los Angeles. We wanted to separate from the reality of our lives. Leave behind not just the kids and the responsibilities, but the newspaper headlines and cable news. Was that even possible?In our all-American S.U.V., I gave it my best Bruce Springsteen-Thunder-Road-I’m-pulling-out-of-here-to-win moment and we tore out of El Paso onto 10 East doing 80 miles per hour through the vast Chihuahuan Desert, passing through long stretches of flat landscape with puffs of sage brush for the three-hour drive ahead of us.Past the border patrol checkpoint, past an abandoned truck stop, with a great old (nonworking) Art Deco-style neon sign that simply read “Truck Stop,” a 1960s relic; when Interstate 10 bypassed Sierra Blanca and it became something of a ghost town. That’s when it sunk in. We were really, finally nowhere.Nightfall came quickly and the bluish Chinati Mountains disappeared in the darkness as we turned onto U.S. 90, a two-lane road leading into Marfa. A refurbished neon sign glowed in the pitch dark night; it read, vertically, in pink, “Stardust,” then underneath in blue, “Motel.” Except there was no motel. Not a soul in sight. And when you’ve been driving for two-plus hours down a dark desert highway, it gets creepy. Sara and I had fallen under the spell of the hypnotic yellow lines down the center of the road. Awful country music streamed from the radio, coming in and out of frequency.That’s when I saw it. A beam of light in the shape of an orb hopped across the road and just as quickly disappeared.I grabbed onto the wheel and screamed and then Sara screamed, “What is it? What! What?”“I think we’re seeing our first U.F.O.”I was half-kidding, half-serious. We were in West Texas. Roswell, N. M., where ominous U.F.O. stories have been churned out for decades, was only four hours from here. Plus Marfa had its own weird phenomenon called the Marfa Lights. Yellowish orbs had been spotted flashing through this desert since the late 1800s. (There’s even a Mystery Lights Viewing Area, a truly unusual roadside center where people gather nightly.)I didn’t pull over because when you think you see a U.F.O. in the desert and there’s no one around, you don’t pull over. I have enough nostalgic alien movies under my belt to know this. However, I slowed down the car and there they were again — orbs the size of grapefruits, miles away. My heart pounded because it was only the beginning of our journey and we had already descended into a Steven Spielberg extraterrestrial movie. But as we drove closer, we realized they weren’t free-floating orbs at all. They were just truck lights dipping in and out of the sightline. And there you have it: My first desert mirage.During our four-day road trip, our home base was El Cosmico, a quirky hotel and campground on 21 acres, filled with vintage trailers (Beth and I stayed in a 24-foot, 1950s Branstrator with a turquoise-painted top), Sioux-style teepees and yurts. Sara and Miriam holed up in a bright pink 1953 Vagabond trailer. That first night we reserved a wood-fired, barrel-like hot tub. We opted for moonlight and naked bodies. We’ve been friends for a quarter of a century and this wasn’t our first time in a hot tub together in our birthday suits. The steam rose above the tub and the moon peeked through as we sipped our wine in the darkness. It felt good to be together. No men.In the morning, while everyone was asleep, I headed over to Marfa Burrito. It was a little house. Inside, Mexican decorations and pictures of Matthew McConaughey covered the wood-paneled walls. A fuchsia poster board listed five burrito choices, including egg and chorizo, bean and cheese and my personal favorite, the Primo, stuffed with beans, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, salsa and cheese, for only $6.50.Ramona Tejada, the owner, was a cute middle-aged woman with glasses and a woven sun hat. I ordered a cheese-and-egg burrito. “Huevos con queso,” I said in my survival Spanish, and she smiled. There were three other women cooking in the kitchen. One man, sitting in the corner, sorted red chilies.We took the day to roam around Marfa, stopping at the Food Shark, a food truck that’s a bit of a culinary institution and a great spot for people watching. You can drive through Marfa in a blink of an eye, but you can’t miss the mix of urbanites and folks who, I’m guessing, were transplanted from hip, urban spaces; people with purple hair and horn-rimmed glasses clomping around in muddy cowboy boots.We drifted from one strange experience after another. First we played Ping-Pong in the local artist Michael Phalen’s gallery. We shopped at Ranch Candy, an oddities-and-gift shop on the main drag, and chatted with the shop owner, an amiable guy with wide silver-rimmed glasses. (I bought an embroidered, vintage Western shirt there for my husband, Andy.)We stopped later at a gas station to fill up the tank, attempted to pump gas from a nonworking pump, then quickly realized that it was not a gas station after all — but an art exhibit. (Instead of prices for gas, the sign read: “ART.” Who knew?) And that night, we saw an experimental chamber opera, “Pancho Villa From a Safe Distance,” about the life of the Mexican Revolutionary general Pancho Villa, at The Crowley Theater, a single-story, weathered stone building with a curved Spanish Colonial facade; a string of white globe lights outlined the building in the velvety black sky.But Marfa also had a dusty, timeworn Texas feel. Turquoise pickup trucks were parked on the street. Most buildings had midcentury Spanish facades. (Marfa is about 60 miles from the Mexican border.) A Union Pacific train ran through the middle of town. We strolled past cattle feeders and beat-up hardware stores with nothing in the window but a deer head and portable gas cans for sale. And if anything speaks old-school cinematic Texas history, it’s the movie “Giant,” starring James Dean and Elizabeth Taylor, filmed here in 1955. Life-size photos from the movie line the 1930s-era Hotel Paisano. Marfa is an eccentric and remarkable mix of artists and cowboys. Their seemingly comfortable coexistence is most likely owed to the vision of the artist Donald Judd. Judd, who died in 1994, is the magnet of art pilgrimages to Marfa. In 1971, a successful minimalist artist, he moved to Marfa with his children to escape the New York art scene, turning abandoned offices of the United States Army Quartermaster Corps into his home and personal work space. La Mansana de Chinati, informally known as The Block, which is part of the Judd Foundation, is a space so large it took up an entire city block and encompassed two airplane hangars.So in the morning, we took a guided tour at The Block. Everything at The Block was symmetrical. The metal and glass doors. The endless bookshelves. The stack of woodcut yellow and blue plexiglass installations, all isolated rectangular blocks, hung vertically on the wall. The concrete raised pool. The plum trees in a line, one after another. Symmetrical, except, one could argue, for the old, yet working, grain mill across the street, with its machinery churning and grinding all afternoon.The mill was loud. Leave it to my friend Miriam to look beyond the art. “You move all the way to the desert,” she said, “and you built an art compound across the street from a grain mill?”Fair point. But it wasn’t the clamor of the mill that bothered me. It was the nine-foot-tall adobe brick wall. I was sick of walls. And eight-foot fences. And border delineations. I lived in a tight suburban New Jersey enclave with one neighbor’s driveway only 10 feet from my house.“We need to drive back out to the desert,” I told my friends after the tour. We all agreed that it was time to go.When you leave Marfa, it’s a deep dive into the rural framework of Texas. Back to the grasses and the yucca. The uninterrupted sky. A whole lot of space to fill. And what a sky it was! It had been so fickle, now finally we saw glimmers of bright blue patches above the long dark ribbon of a road ahead. Look at that road! With nothing on it!“This would be a good time to stand in the middle of the road,” Beth said. And she was the family therapist. The reasonable one! It was a spur of the moment suggestion. No reasoning behind it. We might be getting older, but in Texas, in the desert, you can still pull over, jump in the middle of the road and not a soul will know about it.We hopped out of the car and screamed our heads off, drunk with all of the space. And it was exhilarating! When my kids were little, I told them not to run into the street about 100 times. (Maybe more?) Here we were, four women in our mid-40s. It went against all of our instincts as responsible adults, and we let those instincts go into the wind that night.The sun was quickly dropping into the desert so, after our “I’m the queen of the road” stunt, we got back in the S.U.V. and I revved up to 80 again. In my path were two large black crows, snacking on roadkill. I slowed down a bit so they’d have time to ascend, but one got caught by the wind and it swooped down with a sharp force. My car plunged into it, everyone screamed and the bird propelled into my windshield. I did what any sane person would do when something large is coming at you: I ducked, yet my hands remained steady on the wheel.For whatever reason — maybe it was the desolate road, maybe it was how fast I was driving, or my desert head space — but my instinct was to simply duck, not to swerve. I’m a good driver. I can take a highway or a city street. But this was not a normal reflex. I’m telling you, I didn’t move that wheel. I’m going to chalk it up to adrenaline. Something raced inside of me that said “Get your head down. Now.”After we all calmed down a bit, once the screaming was over, Beth put her hand on my elbow. She asked me if I was O.K. I nodded.“You handled that perfectly,” Beth said, trying to calm me.“I didn’t handle it perfectly at all,” I said. “I killed an enormous bird.” I knew it was dead. It had catapulted into the field behind us; I saw it in the rearview mirror when I briefly peeked.The manic energy leading up to that moment flattened out. Music turned down. Everyone still. But that black bird was not my albatross. I wouldn’t let it be, I told myself (and it wasn’t, but all of that driving will play tricks on you), and so we sailed along the road, quieter, through the low tawny grass, past the sprawling ranches along U.S. 90 to a spot we’d all been talking about visiting: The Prada Marfa.Then there it was, a shining beacon of consumerism, nestled into the landscape, this landmark, Prada Marfa, a fake Prada store, a symbol of wealth and prosperity. Right in the middle of the desert, about 37 miles northwest of Marfa. It’s a small building that looks like a stand-alone storefront with wide windows. A few purses and shoes on display, donated by Miuccia Prada. Absolutely nothing else but miles and miles of empty ranchland on each side of it.This building is a lone rider, is as if someone had airlifted it into the desert. Or an apocalyptic relic, the only sign left of modern commercialism.The Berlin-based artists Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset built the cultural landmark in 2005 with the help of the Marfa art collective, Ballroom Marfa. In 2014, Beyoncé did a split jump in front of the structure, posting it to her Instagram and sealing the Prada Marfa’s cultural fate forever.A pink sky erupted around the building as we modeled in our most Instagrammable poses. This may sound cliché, but at sunset, it truly does feel like you’ve entered a painting. So yes, the visit to Prada Marfa was worth it. Dead bird and all.In the morning, we hit Marfa Burrito again to fuel up before our drive out of town.Ramona recognized me and waved from the kitchen with her brilliant smile, calling out, “Hola, chica!” This time her sister-in-law Lucy, a warm woman with beautiful blue eyes and thick lashes, took my order. The line was out the door.We made our way up State Highway 17 to Davis Mountains State Park, which averages about 5,000 feet above sea level, for a hike. We usually hike at least once on our road trips — why not hit the highest mountain range in Texas? It was sunny and bright that morning, this time, the Chinati Mountains in the distance popped up over the desert landscape. We played an eclectic soundtrack: Fleetwood Mac’s “Sara,” the B-52’s “Dance This Mess Around” and Willie Nelson’s “On The Road Again.”“I don’t want to go home,” Sara said. A cancer survivor, she didn’t want to face follow-up tests. But it wasn’t just that. I knew she didn’t want to get back to work, the day-to-day routine. None of us did. And who wants to when you can surround yourself with art, eat fantastic food and drive on long, empty roads. This trip was a dream. I missed my kids and husband on every trip I’d ever been on, but this time, I was content to drive my way into this beautiful country of ours, through the fields and crevices and never reappear again.A few hours later, after the hike, we pulled into Blue Agate and Rocks, a small roadside crystal shop — the sign above the door simply says “Rock Shop” — in Fort Davis, about 21 miles from Marfa. Owner Donna Trammell was a petite, older woman, her face etched with lines, perhaps from years of crystal-hunting in the West Texas sun.“How do you pick a crystal?” I asked her, dizzy from the dozens of glittering rocks that packed her shelves. “You have so many.”“You have to listen to the rocks. They talk to you,” she said, passing a row of 30-pound purple amethysts and smaller, metallic iron pyrite. “I’m serious. If you pass one spot and pick it up, it’s because the rock is talking to you.”A large chunk of selenite, also known as a shaman stone, spoke to me. It was a cloudy white crystal with thick jags, a little larger than the palm of my hand and reminded me of the moon.It was our last day in West Texas and we were determined to pack it in. Still in our sweaty hiking clothes, we drove straight to The Chinati Foundation (another decommissioned army base that Mr. Judd had turned into an art compound) to experience Mr. Judd’s “15 untitled works in concrete,” which is essentially 15 giant gray rectangles settled in the middle of massive ranchland. I ran my fingers through the high yellowed grasses, relishing the open space and these architectural formations.Maybe my face seemed content and wise, because a small group approached us with a confused look. “Help us,” a woman from Houston said, pleading. “Did you get it? We don’t get it. Help us get it.”We tried some textbook explanations about how the concrete boxes are unexpected, an alteration of reality. When none of that worked, I told her in my blunt East Coast manner, “We don’t have fields like this in New Jersey.”Just down the road was the permanent exhibit, “From Dawn to Dusk,” by the large-scale installation artist Robert Irwin that had opened in July 2016. There were two entrances: One is light, the other is dark. We walked in from the dark side, gradually making our way into the light. This is the way you want to end a trip. Basking in the light, completely transformed and blissed out.And in the light, that was when we spotted him: a tall, handsome cowboy giving a small art tour. Every Thelma and Louise road trip story like ours needed a Brad Pitt moment and we found ours at The Chinati Foundation.His name was Chris Cole and truly, he looked like Richard Prince’s iconic Marlboro Man with his unmussed brown corduroy jacket, his tall cowboy build, his long hair and his 10-gallon hat. We overheard him talking about ranch water and because there’s nothing wrong with flirting, we asked what it was. Turns out ranch water was a simple mix of tequila, lime juice and soda water.“Nothing special, but fun to say,” he said. “Thanks for coming all the way to Marfa.” And he seemed like he meant it.Chris the Cowboy — or as we deemed him later that night, the “Hottie from Chinati,” as we gulped down our ranch waters at the Hotel Saint George bar where we stopped in for a drink after dinner — had walked away into the sunset.Our last night in the trailer, the four of us cozied up under colorful serapes, reading animal spirit cards. We were wistful about leaving Marfa and leaving each other. It would probably be another year until the four of us set out on another adventure.Before we left town on that bright Sunday morning, we stopped again at Marfa Burrito. Ramona and Lucy invited us to the back, in the kitchen, where we hugged them and thanked them for feeding us for our entire trip. “That’s what we do, feed people and make them feel good,” Lucy said. They certainly did.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the Davis Mountains. The highest point in Texas is Guadalupe Peak, not the Davis Mountains. A photo caption with an earlier version of the article incorrectly identified a nonprofit organization that provides art classes for young people. The photo is of Marfa Contemporary, not the Marfa Studio of the Arts."

But I wandered down there recently because of a plan put forward by a corporate relation of Google to transform the area into a city of tomorrow.The proposal by Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, doesn’t go for half measures, particularly when it comes to technology. As I wrote in my story, the new community, to be called Quayside, will bristle with sensors, including cameras.The plan is to use that data to optimize tomorrow’s cities.Not surprisingly, the idea has provoked strong reactions, raising concerns about privacy, the best way to plan cities and the effect on democracy.Early on, Bianca Wylie began an ever expanding list of questions on The Torontoist, an urban affairs website.And well over 100 readers posted comments on my article.“A fascinating vision,” Lewis Sternberg wrote from Ottawa. “History would show, however, that central planning (no matter how benign) does not make neighborhoods. It can start them but it is their inhabitants that will remake it in the long term.”R. Fishell from Toronto wrote, “I am a skeptic of Google, social media and the end of the separation of personal and public spaces,” but added, “I am in favor of letting the experiment proceed as well as encouraging all the public discourse with its resident messiness to evaluate what works and what doesn’t.”While Sidewalk’s plan eclipses in scale and scope everything that came before it, the idea of using data collection and analysis common in the digital world to shape the physical world is not unique to the company or its sibling Google. The federal government is running a “smart cities” competition that will give out millions of dollars to local governments looking to reshape their communities through the “use of data and connected technology.”Let’s continue the debate. Please send your thoughts about shaping cities by marrying the virtual and physical worlds to nytcanada@nytimes.comRead: City of the Future? Humans, Not Technology, Are the Challenge in TorontoTo begin the new year, The Times’s Food department will turn its collective gaze to Canada. Starting toward the end of next week, articles and recipes from Canada will appear online. The print version of the Food section on Jan. 17 will be devoted to Canada and will include a piece about butter tarts. (My great failing as a Canadian is that I have no taste for them.)We’re also holding two related events. On Jan. 16, Sam Sifton, the food editor, will lead a public conversation in Montreal with David McMillan, the restaurant owner best known for Joe Beef. Last year Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dined with President Barack Obama at Mr. McMillan’s neighboring restaurant, Liverpool House.Anyone who has read Mr. Sifton’s recipes, food stories or his Cooking newsletter knows that he has eclectic interests, strongly held views and a deep knowledge of cooking. Mr. McMillan, whom I interviewed last year, has all of that but delivers it at an even higher volume. It won’t be a dull evening.The event is at 7 p.m. and will be across the street from Joe Beef, at the Corona Theatre. Go here to buy tickets and, at the prompt, enter the code NYTCooking. That will take $5 off the $25 price.The previous evening, Jan. 15, will find Mr. Sifton at the University of Toronto’s Isabel Bader Theatre. There, he’ll be joined by David Sax, a Times food writer, and some of Toronto’s Syrian chefs and restaurateurs.Their talk will the followed by a reception featuring Syrian food.Tickets for the Toronto event can be purchased here. They are $30 but Canada Letter readers can chop off $10 with the code Cooking.Much of the reporting about workplace sexual harassment and the abuse of power by men has focused on the entertainment industry.That was certainly the case this week in Canada. Albert Schultz resigned as the artistic director of Toronto’s Soulpepper Theatre Company after four actors filed a lawsuit against him and the theater. Mr. Schultz has said that he intends to “vigorously” defend himself.But most people have jobs in far less glamorous fields. And in the blue-collar world, women must often deal not only with supervisors but also with co-workers who are harassers.Women who work at Ford Motor Company plants in Chicago told their stories to Susan Chira and Catrin Einhorn, herself a Chicago native. A powerful union and an employer with sophisticated human resources policies offered them little protection.

5b30785c068401528a2b67dc,Are Fabricators the Most Important People in the Art World?,2018-06-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/t-magazine/art-fabricators.html,The New York Times,"THE IMAGE OF the artist feverishly working alone as first light dawns through the tall, grimy windows of the atelier dies hard. No matter how monumental or unwieldy their creations, we prefer to imagine artists as solitary figures, their hands stained and raw: Rodin in his aerie in Meudon scratching at half-carved marble torsos; Bacon hunched over a giant canvas in South Kensington amid detritus; Calder in Connecticut, beavering away beneath a wave of bent wire. Reality, of course, is more crowded. Sculpture and assemblage have grown to immense proportions in recent years as the art business itself has ballooned. As new techniques, materials and computer-assisted design make otherworldly shapes and surfaces possible, it’s become increasingly hard to ignore the man behind the curtain: the off-site fabricators who actually make the thing itself, whether it’s a hulking metal totem by Ellsworth Kelly or a Minimalist cube by Robert Morris.Mastering your craft may have been a requirement and a point of pride for artists during the Renaissance, but the art schools of today emphasize idea over execution. In the digitally enhanced multimedia era, the mark of the artist’s hand is far less important than the concept, which means the collaborative work of creation is often a complex feat of engineering. Andy Warhol, with his army of assistants churning out silk-screens, may have been the first to introduce the industrial side of process into the public consciousness. But in fact, the idea of outsourced art goes back to at least as early as the 17th century, when artists like Rembrandt would have a large staff of assistants produce paintings that were signed by the artist but not made by his hand. With the introduction of Pop and Conceptual Art in the mid-to-late ’50s, which found a generation of artists increasingly interested in the sheer spectacle of their practice, there was a corresponding need for skilled workers who could bend steel or cast in resin. Since then, fabrication has become an increasingly common, if little discussed, component of contemporary art. While some large art fabricators, including Carlson & Company in the San Fernando Valley in California, which helped to perfect the mirror technique of Jeff Koons’s candy-colored stainless steel balloon animals, and Lippincott’s, the venerable Connecticut firm responsible for Barnett Newman’s 1963-69 “Broken Obelisk” and Claes Oldenburg’s giant clothespin sculptures, have scaled back or shut down because of financial pressures, a number of New York-based fabricators — Prototype New York, Milgo/Bufkin, Lite Brite Neon Studio — persevere. The details of what they do may be invisible, but without them, some of the most defining works of contemporary art probably wouldn’t exist. IT’S NO WONDER, then, that many fabricators start out as artists themselves, or are at least drawn to the inherent romance of the field. When Bruce Gitlin graduated from Lehigh University in the early ’60s, he agreed to join Milgo — the family business, which began in 1916 making horse-drawn carriages and had by then graduated to truck-body fabrication in its vast space in Greenpoint, Brooklyn — but he had an ultimatum: The firm had to quit making vehicles (too boring) and instead start doing architectural metalwork to pay the bills while also working with artists.The shop, now called Milgo/Bufkin, quickly became legendary. Gitlin collaborated with Robert Smithson to construct sculptures that included his rocks and with Oldenburg on a 1999 nine-foot-high round pink typewriter eraser built out of painted aluminum and fiberglass, as well as a massive sandbox of horse manure for the Whitney into which Oldenburg plunged an enormous trowel. One day in 1968, Michael Heizer, who would become famous for his ostentatious land art pieces in the Nevada desert, came in with a roll of toilet paper; he wanted Gitlin to build a four-foot pedestal with a bulletproof case over it. “Martin Luther King had just been killed, and Heizer had fired his pistol into the roll,” says Gitlin. “He said: ‘That is my anger. I want to preserve it.’”Many art projects motivated by passion are money losers, of course. In recent decades, Gitlin, 75, who is now chairman of the board of Pratt Institute and conceived the college’s capacious sculpture garden, has concentrated on metal, including works by Richard Serra and Tom Wesselmann and most of Robert Indiana’s “Love” sculptures. To support his obsession with art — he is also a collector — he takes on projects for commercial clients, some of which have become iconic in their own right, including the huge red “9” in front of the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street and the bronze interiors and exteriors of Van Cleef & Arpels on Fifth Avenue. Just across the bridge in Long Island City, Ted Lawson of the small, well-regarded Prototype New York, takes a more modest approach, reflecting a modern paradox: As large-scale art fabricators have struggled, some boutique-size operations with what might be called a handmade ethos have flourished. Prototype New York fabricates perhaps a dozen commissions a year, and takes on few new clients — but most are deep-pocketed ones, including Mariko Mori, Ghada Amer and Yoko Ono.Now 47, Lawson began his career as an assistant in the mid-1990s to Koons, whose teeming factory of helpers (their ranks have at times swelled to some 120 people) came to symbolize the mainstreaming of manufactured art, producing intricate paintings made by over a dozen workers through a color-by-numbers system. While fabricating serves as a buffer to keep the lights on and production consistent, Lawson considers himself “first and foremost” an artist; his interdisciplinary work ranges from highly realistic figures cast in silicone to painted abstraction. Tables on the main floor of his 5,000-square-foot studio display a series of molds for plaster versions of the 150 crumpled red Solo cups that were part of a piece that Paula Crown showed last year at London’s 10 Hanover gallery.To Lawson, fabricating is a bit like producing a record; you are trying to enhance the artist’s vision, which is sometimes meticulously conceived and other times inchoate. Every work has three components, he says — concept, material and process — and at times he helps with each of them. For Crown’s Solo cups, for example, which were inspired by her seeing scads of them discarded on the floor after a party, they discussed whether the cups should be made from soft or hard material, if they should be all the same shape or if there should be one giant one, in stainless steel, like Anish Kapoor’s famous reflective “bean” in Chicago (itself fabricated by a team of about 70 from Performance Structures Inc. in Oakland, Calif., and MTH Industries in Illinois). With each artist — Lawson only works with a few at a time — he develops a unique process. For her “Wave U.F.O.” series from the 2000s, Mori, an artist known for her intricate sci-fi installations, began with 3D renderings from which Lawson made foam models; Mori then drew on them with pencil in his studio. Together, they rendered them in plaster and, finally, acrylic. “At a certain point, we got so in tune we barely had to talk,” he says. With Ono, who is “all concept,” he was given only cursory instructions and three weeks to make a 2003 piece: 100 cast body parts to be heaped on the floor like garbage — arms, legs, torsos. The only time he met her was at the opening. “She asked, ‘How did you enjoy making the piece?’” he says.The relationship between artist and fabricator can be intimate — even, at its best, symbiotic. Glenn Ligon is a conceptual artist who often uses text in his work (paintings with the phrase “I am a man,” for instance, to address issues of gender and identity). He had long admired the Duchampian neon sculptures that Bruce Nauman started making in the 1960s, such as a sign that said simply “death,” with the letters “eat” lit up in a contrasting color. But he hadn’t considered using neon himself for his text-based work until Matt Dilling, the genial bearded fellow whom he knew only as a neighbor in the space below Ligon’s studio in Gowanus, invited him for a tour in 2005. For Ligon, encountering Lite Brite, where artisans working for clients like Bergdorf Goodman use blow torches to bend glass tubing, which they then fill with gas and connect to an electrical charge, was kismet. “It might never have happened without Matt,” he says. Neon was not merely graphically appealing to the artist, but pleasingly paradoxical: Associated with crass commercialism, it is in fact entirely handmade. It was a retail client of Dilling’s that inspired Ligon’s landmark 2005 work “Warm Broad Glow,” with its text, “negro sunshine,” painted black on the front to eerily reflect light off the wall behind it. “Glenn wanted to do black neon, and I said, ‘Well, you do know that black is the absence of light, right, so that might be tough,’” Dilling recalled. “But I had worked on a sign for Burberry and had to do the plaid, which has black in it, so I painted the front of some of the lines black to represent that. Glenn saw it and said ‘That’s it.’” In 2015, when the New School commissioned a similar work, the artist installed “For Comrades and Lovers,” adapted from a book of poems by Walt Whitman, across nearly 200 feet of the ground floor and visible from the street. The project was nearly halted because some neon tubes have trace amounts of mercury, which would disqualify the building for LEED certification. Dilling suggested an alternative that has no mercury; the only catch was that it came only in a single color, a dignified lavender. “It was so perfect,” Ligon says.The association with Ligon has led Dilling to commissions from other artists, including Theaster Gates, as well as the addition of a sprawling work space for Lite Brite in Kingston, N.Y., a postindustrial city on the Hudson River a two-and-a-half-hour drive north of Brooklyn. As artists’ interest in neon has swelled in recent years, so has Dilling’s willingness to follow them to strange places, both aesthetically and literally. This past spring, Dilling worked with the Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan, embedding in the ground at the Desert X art festival in the Coachella Valley a 100,000-square-foot neon rendering of the words “I Am,” designed to seem as though it was exploding out of the earth itself. In addition to construction, Dilling had to maintain the work during the 10 weeks it was up — another unsung part of the fabricator’s challenging and often uncredited effort.“We thought it might be hard to keep the electricity going and things like that, but a lot of the time was spent chasing lizards out of the holes where the transformers were,” he says. “I look at that as a total testament to art being a very unpredictable thing. Which is what makes it so worthwhile being part of.” "
5a425e987c459f246b63cc81,"In a Chinese Enclave of Canada, the Sweet Escape of Karaoke",2017-12-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/world/canada/canada-chinese-karaoke.html,The New York Times,"RICHMOND, British Columbia — What sort of karaoke joint offers 18 kinds of bubble tea but only one Abba song?If you’re a Chinese immigrant living in metropolitan Vancouver, then you’ve probably already been there: Party World KTV, a branch of the Asian karaoke chain, which looks as if a wedding-cake-inspired U.F.O. had just landed in the middle of this majority ethnic-Chinese city.It’s a popular destination for anyone looking to warble a favorite Chinese pop song, accompanied by music videos occasionally set in the Ming dynasty and frequently featuring people crying.On a recent Friday night, anyone meant Karns You, a bleach-blond transplant from China’s coastal Guangdong Province. He was on his feet, eyes closed, belting out a rock ballad by the Hong Kong pop star Eason Chan. His girlfriend sat beside him, transfixed by her smartphone. Not that it mattered — Mr. You was there for karaoke, or KTV as it’s known in China, a guilty pleasure he indulges in often four times a week.“Sometimes you just want to sing, and then sing more,” said Mr. You, 30, who works for his uncle’s construction company, after his microphone session had ended. “KTV is the best way to get rid of stress.”With thousands of songs in Mandarin and Cantonese, platters of cured beef and a maze of private rooms packed almost entirely with Chinese immigrants, the Richmond satellite of Party World, long a karaoke staple across China, is a crooning microcosm of Canada’s rapidly shifting urban cultural landscape.Richmond’s population is now 54 percent ethnic Chinese and three-quarters nonwhite or aboriginal, according to the 2016 census, a stark change from 25 years ago, when Caucasians made up nearly 70 percent of residents. Restaurants serving cuisines from practically every Chinese province line the city’s streets, where Mandarin and a slew of Chinese dialects are far more likely to be heard than English.But the city’s demographic transformation has fueled ethnic tensions, sometimes pitting neighbor against neighbor. For years, some residents have complained about the proliferation of commercial signs written solely in Chinese, which prompted the City Council in the fall to adopt a policy encouraging businesses to include English on at least 50 percent of signage.In December, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal agreed to hear a case filed by a group of condominium owners who say they have been racially discriminated against by their elected condominium council, whose members are all Chinese and conducted meetings only in Mandarin, refusing to use English.While many residents take pride in Richmond’s ethnic diversity, some discovered fliers in their mailboxes in the days after Donald J. Trump’s election as United States president that read “Step aside, whitey! The Chinese are taking over!” and exhorted white people to “Save Richmond” by joining the so-called alt-right movement.But cultural (if not always musical) harmony resounds at Party World, one of several karaoke clubs in Richmond that cater to the hankerings of metro Vancouver’s soaring Chinese population.“KTV is crazy fun because you can act ridiculous together,” said Jeffrey Hou, 20, a student at the University of British Columbia, as he waited for a private room with a large group of friends, all of whom were of Asian descent. Mr. Hou said he did karaoke every few weeks, with a well-practiced setlist that includes Eminem, Taylor Swift and Linkin Park.In the spirit of the art form’s cheesiness, his friend and fellow university student, Evan Wang, 20, confessed to a preference for Christmas songs. Which, exactly? “Everything,” he said, blushing.Not that anyone was judging, least of all this reporter, who for the record has whiled away many nights in karaoke emporiums in Beijing, where he was known to deliver spirited renditions of ’90s boy band classics and would not leave until Garth Brooks’s “Friends in Low Places” was completed, much to the delight of his companions and the odd waiter.Sadly, the halcyon days of Chinese karaoke, with its legendary free buffets and private rooms ornately decorated to resemble gingerbread houses and outer space, are no more. In recent years, Party World and other chains in mainland China have closed scores of outlets as social media and mobile karaoke apps have led to steep declines in business, if not hangovers.For many of Richmond’s Party World customers, crooning on a couch for around $18 an hour is a chance to relive their youth and a rare (or frequent) opportunity to let loose their insanely talented inner diva.For instance:Upstairs, in the Empress Lounge, a karaoke bar outfitted with fuchsia chandeliers, copious amounts of alcohol and booths facing a gigantic projector screen, four cellphone salespeople had gathered for an evening of song and beer. “We came here because we can drink,” said Jiang Ben, 25, a Chinese immigrant whose parents sent him to Canada six years ago for university and who regularly sings karaoke. “Twice a month for sure, no lie.”Beside him sat Wang Yang, 28, a native of China’s central Henan Province who goes by the name Sonique. “It’s French,” he said, before launching into an easy-listening Mandarin hit by Wang Leehom, an American Chinese pop sensation who grew up in upstate New York.“Black ponytail curled in a bun, wrapped around all my loving thoughts of you,” the Wangs crooned. On screen, the singer strummed a guitar while standing on the roof of a pickup truck in a field of wildflowers. “Cut a strand of your hair, lay it on my chest.” Later, Mr. Wang explained why Chinese tend to favor heartbreaking solo performances, in contrast to Westerners’ preference for raucous group renditions of, say, Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline.”“Asians are introverted,” he said. “We hide our emotions inside, so KTV lets us express our feelings about sad times, like high school breakups.” He paused, looking wistful. “This totally takes me back.”For most of the evening, their co-worker, Qi Qi, 23, a woman from China’s coastal Jiangsu Province, kept quiet. “I’m shy,” she said.But even Ms. Qi could not resist Party World’s siren song, or at least, Celine Dion. As the theme from “Titanic” began to gush from the speakers, she grabbed the microphone and let it out, singing as if no one were listening, even though they were."
5a34465d7c459f246b63b557,"Marina Popovich, Record-Breaking Soviet Test Pilot, Is Dead",2017-12-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/obituaries/marina-popovich-record-breaking-soviet-test-pilot-is-dead.html,The New York Times,"Marina L. Popovich, a test pilot who broke more than 100 flying records and who was the first Soviet woman to break the sound barrier, died in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia on Nov. 30.Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, announced her death on Facebook and YouTube. The Tass news agency said she died in a hospital.Her age was unclear; Tass listed her as 86, but it also said she had added six years to her age as a young woman in order to enroll in a military flight school.Ms. Popovich followed in the footsteps of female aviators who had gained prominence in the Soviet military during World War II, some of whom were called the Night Witches by German forces.Overcoming hurdles presented by both her gender and her diminutive height, she attained the rank of colonel in the Soviet Air Force as a test pilot, setting dozens of flying records for distance and speed, some of which still stand.“The first flights on a high-speed fighter jet were breathtaking,” she told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda in 2012. “Before I even pull up the chassis on takeoff, the sky turns dark violet, and there are small unblinking stars in the zenith.”She broke the sound barrier in 1964 flying a MiG-21 fighter jet for the State Red-Banner Scientific Research Institute, run by the Air Force.“A pilot is overcome with a special kind of inner excitement after breaking the sound barrier,” she said.She was the third woman to achieve that feat. The American pilot Jacqueline Cochran was the first, in 1953. Jacqueline Auriol of France broke the sound barrier later that year.Marina Lavrentyevna Vasilyeva was born in what is now the Smolensk region of Russia, west of Moscow. Her father was a musician, and she was expected to become one, too, until German troops advanced on her town in World War II, forcing the family to flee.They settled in Novosibirsk, more than 2,000 miles to the east, where she decided to become a pilot “to take revenge on the fascists,” she told a magazine for military officers’ wives in 2011. She said she had also been inspired by her uncle, who was a fighter pilot.She made her first attempt to learn to fly at age 14. But at 4 feet 9 inches tall, she was so small — “practically a Lilliputian,” she said — that her feet could not reach the pedals. Determined nevertheless, she hung herself upside down using alpine ropes in the hope that it would make her grow. Whether by those means or naturally, at 16 she ultimately cleared 5 feet and was able to join an air club.But her advancement was stalled by bureaucratic barriers; once the war was over, women were no longer permitted to fly.She managed to gain an audience with Kliment Voroshilov, a prominent Soviet military officer, and she was accepted into an aviation academy. She also graduated from a civil aviation academy in Leningrad.Despite their initial skepticism, most male instructors and pilots came to be in awe of her.“She learned strikingly fast,” Nikolai A. Bondarenko, a test pilot, wrote in his memoirs, adding that she had piloted an L-29 fighter jet “as confidently as she walked the ground.”In “The First Soviet Cosmonaut Team: Their Lives and Legacies” (2009), the space historians Colin Burgess and Rex Hall wrote that most of Ms. Popovich’s success “would lead to later speculation that she was about to become the first Soviet woman to travel into space.”At one point the Soviet space program did train female cosmonauts, and Ms. Popovich was admitted for testing. But ultimately only one, Valentina Tereshkova, was sent into space. Ms. Popovich said that she was advised to focus on her family, and that she was forced out of the program.“I and a group of women were rejected,” she told the news site Pravda.ru in 2011. “Officially I was told: ‘You have a small daughter, so we’re not going to take the risk, we’re only taking unmarried women.’ Well then, why did they subject me to testing for two months, torment me?”Her disappointment was heightened by the fact that she lived among some of the first cosmonauts. Her first husband, Pavel R. Popovich, trained with Yuri A. Gagarin, who in 1961 became the first human to orbit Earth. Mr. Gagarin was their neighbor in Star City, the space training center near Moscow.Ms. Popovich told Seagull, a Russian-American magazine, in an interview published in 2008 that she even declared a hunger strike in protest, only to be told by generals overseeing the cosmonauts that she “should let your husband fly first, and then you can.”Her marriage to Mr. Popovich, with whom she had two daughters, ended in divorce in the 1980s. She is survived by her second husband, Boris A. Zhikhorev, also a pilot; her daughters, Natalia and Oksana; and three grandchildren.Ms. Popovich, who said she had encountered U.F.O.s as a pilot, came to believe in extraterrestrials and wrote a book on the subject, “U.F.O. Glasnost,” published in 1991. She contended that both the Soviet and United States governments had covered up the presence of alien life.“Before we pilots used to be afraid to say a word about this because we’d be sent straight to the loony bin,” she told Seagull magazine.Flying opened her eyes to the ecological damage being done to the earth and led her on a spiritual journey, she told The Los Angeles Times in 1991, when she attended the Whole Earth Expo.“I saw rivers drying up, lakes dying, the whole ecological disaster,” she said. “I knew we would have to call a higher intelligence to enlighten us, to guide us through this mess.”There were, Ms. Popovich insisted, no atheists among her fellow pilots.“We didn’t go to church, we didn’t pray, but we had faith,” she said in 2008. “Test pilots are in contact with something sublime.”"
560b44de38f0d84e27991262,"Ionel Talpazan, Whose U.F.O. Art Had Sightings All Over, Dies at 60",2015-09-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/arts/design/ionel-talpazan-whose-ufo-art-had-sightings-all-over-dies-at-60.html,The New York Times,"Ionel Talpazan, an outsider artist from Romania who sold his visionary works of U.F.O.s and life in outer space on the sidewalks of Manhattan before being discovered in the late 1980s, died on Sept. 21 in Manhattan. He was 60. The cause was complications of a stroke and advanced diabetes, Aarne Anton, his dealer at the American Primitive Gallery in SoHo, said. Mr. Talpazan claimed that one night in the Romanian countryside, when he was 8, a strange, hovering shape slowly descended from the sky, enveloping him in a celestial blue light, and then disappeared. The experience haunted him and became the source of his art.His paintings, drawings and sculptures dealt, obsessively, with U.F.O.s and their inner workings, often shown in cross section and heavily annotated in Romanian. He insisted that his work had value not only for art lovers but also for NASA scientists, since it articulated the magnetic forces and antimatter at work in the propulsion systems of his spaceships.“My art is about the big mystery in life,” he told the journal Western Folklore in 2008. “How did we get here on planet Earth? Why are we here? Is there life on other planets?” Ionel Talpazan (pronounced yah-NEL TAL-puh-zan) was born on Aug. 16, 1955, in the commune of Petrachioaia, Romania. After being given up by his parents, he was raised by foster parents in Maineasca, one of the commune’s four villages.His close encounter with a U.F.O. occurred when, fearing a beating for misbehavior, he slipped out of his bedroom window in the middle of the night and walked out into the surrounding countryside, where he stood transfixed by what he called “a blue energy” radiating from a mysterious source overhead. The incident left him confused, but also deeply interested in the idea of space travel, and he set about rendering his interplanetary visions, especially U.F.O.s, on paper. “I felt that by drawing them, I might penetrate their mystery,” he told The Independent of London in 1996.He escaped from Romania, where he had worked in the construction trade, by swimming across the Danube to Yugoslavia in 1987. After several months living in a United Nations camp in Belgrade, he was granted political asylum by the United States and emigrated to New York.A television documentary on U.F.O.s rekindled his interest in space, and he began drawing hypothetical interplanetary spacecraft. “He was interested not so much in aliens as in otherworldly technology,” said Daniel Wojcik, whose book “Outsider Art, Trauma and Visionary Worlds” will be published by the University Press of Mississippi next year. “He thought flying saucers would help bring about a better world by introducing a benevolent technology.”In New York, Mr. Talpazan lived hand-to-mouth, at times sleeping in a cardboard box near Columbus Circle. He sold his work on the sidewalk, becoming a familiar sight at the entrance to the annual Outsider Art Fair, then held in the Puck Building in SoHo.He was discovered by the art dealer Henry Tobler, known as Jay, who saw him selling work outside the Museum of Modern Art and wrote about him in 1990 in Folk Art Messenger, the journal of the Folk Art Society of America. In the 1996 exhibition “Visions of Space & UFOs in Art,” at the American Primitive Gallery in Manhattan, more than a dozen of Mr. Talpazan’s works covered one wall, some of them bought by the artists Brice Marden and Terry Winters. The following year, at the same gallery, he was the subject of a solo show, “Ionel Talpazan: U.F.O.: Art & Science,” and at the Musée d’Art Brut in Neuilly-sur-Marne, France.Mr. Talpazan rendered his U.F.O.s in various guises. Some adhered to an illustrational realism; others were abstract and heavily patterned like mandalas. Some works showed a single U.F.O. lifting off from an unidentified planet. Others showed multiple saucers engaged in battle or disappearing into a wormhole. His titles were matter-of-fact yet otherworldly: “Red UFOs and the Statue of Liberty,” “Father and Son in Space,” “UFOs Over NYC.” His U.F.O. sculptures, a little wider than a Frisbee, were made of plaster and painted silver or blue, then outfitted with brightly colored portholes and exhaust pipes and set on pedestals made from scavenged parts. In the New Jersey newspaper The Star-Ledger in 1997, the critic Dan Bischoff wrote that they resembled “those old metal tops that you sent spinning by pushing a spiral rod down into the center, big and rounded and Art Deco-looking, like two hubcaps from a Studebaker stuck together.”Mr. Talpazan’s work was exhibited at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin.In 2013, work by Mr. Talpazan was included in “The Alternative Guide to the Universe” at the Hayward Gallery in London and “Farfetched: Mad Science, Fringe Architecture and Visionary Engineering” at the Gregg Museum of Art and Design in Raleigh, N.C. This year he was part of the exhibition “Arstronomy” at La Casa Encendida in Madrid.Mr. Talpazan, who lived in Harlem, is survived by two brothers and two sisters. About a year ago, on taking American citizenship, he legally changed his name to Adrian DaVinci.“My art shows spiritual technology, something beautiful and beyond human imagination, that comes from another galaxy,” he told Western Folklore. “Something superior in intelligence and technology. So, in relative way, this is like the God. It is perfect.”"
5b1f8ba0068401528a2b30ce,"On an Arizona Road Trip, Miles of Family Firsts",2018-06-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/travel/arizona-family-road-trip.html,The New York Times,"Behind us was Tucson and three days of living like old-time movie stars at the glamorous Arizona Inn, a hideaway in the heart of one of the nation’s funkiest university towns. Ahead of us were the mystical red rocks of Sedona and, as the trip’s headliner, the Grand Canyon. We were in the middle of Arizona, however, when I understood that we were on a family vacation to remember, one that my wife and I would cherish and one that our soon-to-be-teenage son would certainly tell his children about. What makes for a great family vacation? It’s more than the sights seen or adventures endured. It’s a feeling of cohesion and shared discovery, surprises and simple pleasures.I first experienced this in 1976 with a drive east from Kansas City in a Ford LTD to celebrate the country’s bicentennial. I saw our nation’s capital, Washington, D.C., for the first time, then was on to Philadelphia where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution crafted, and finally we pulled into New York City where the tall ships were gathered in the harbor.The memory of that journey was triggered, of all things, by an In-N-Out burger or, more specifically, Jack’s wide-eyed look of joy as he bit into this storied fast food for the first time. He had already trekked through the desert and been introduced to mountain oysters (more on that later) by a pair of Tucson natives with storytelling skills that equaled their pride in their hometown.His enthusiastic appetite transported me back to one of the highlights of my trip: eating ice cream at the long-gone Howard Johnson’s at 46th Street and Broadway. The Times Square characters and seedy landscape surrounding us were intoxicating to a Midwestern boy. Likewise, the desert, its coyotes and tall tales about the American West were now transporting a Manhattan kid to a world he had only seen in textbooks.Better, the three of us were sharing these firsts together, milestones made even sweeter by the fact that we would be celebrating my son’s 13th birthday later in the week. I wish I could say this was because of meticulous planning. The Drapes, unfortunately, don’t roll that way. The truth was that I had a commitment in Tucson that overlapped with my son’s winter school break. Only a couple of weeks out did my wife, Mary, remind me that we’d be traveling for my son’s birthday.Trust me: Good things can happen to those who make it up as they go.The first bit of magic was scoring a room at the Arizona Inn, which landed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. With its rouge-tile-roofed casitas hidden among orange trees and moated by roses, the resort oozes Old World elegance from the handmade furniture in its rooms to a postcard-perfect badminton court. It was built in 1930 by Isabella Greenway, Arizona’s first congresswoman, and remains family owned. Genuine stars such as Gary Cooper, Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant once were regulars. Most guests rarely venture off its 14 acres, whiling away their day poolside or reading on a chaise longue in their walled off patio or taking high tea in the inn’s library. We, however, headed out mainly to absorb a city that moves at its own languid pace. No one is in much of a hurry here — not University of Arizona students, and not the snow birds (largely of the Midwestern and Canadian variety). It was Tucson’s desert moonscape and Old West roots that we were most interested in. We found the former at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum ($21.95 admission for adults, $8.95 for those ages 3 to 12), which really is more preserve than museum as most of its 100-acre exhibit space is outside and along two miles of trails. It’s a living Intro to the Desert class. Its animal collection contains 4,892 specimens of 242 species. Hits were the javelina (a not very attractive feral pig), bighorn sheep and the gray fox. Its plants number 56,445 specimens. Think all kinds of cactus. Mineral and fossil collections count 16,853 specimens.We found our real inner cowboy at the Mountain Oyster Club, thanks to Wendy Davis, the director of the University of Arizona’s Racetrack Industry Program. We know each other from the racetrack, one of the more eclectic journalism beats I've enjoyed for two decades. The private club is named, tongue-firmly-placed-in-cheek, for what some believe is a delicacy: Bull testicles. In fact, by inverting “Oyster” and turning the “M,” upside down, the club created an illustrative logo: OW!The mountain oysters come fried and served with a cocktail sauce and are served throughout the Southwest (you can find them at El Corral, one of Tucson’s oldest restaurants).I liked them. They were a non-starter, however, with Mary and Jack. “There are many colorful stories of how the Mountain Oyster Club came to be. There is probably a thread of truth in most of them,” according to the club history on its website. “The most common versions say that it was begun by a group of cowboys, playboys, ranchers, polo players, racehorse types, and others whose unacceptable behavior had gotten them thrown out of all of the respectable establishments in Tucson.”Along with a sense of humor, the Mountain Oyster Club — founded in 1948 — serves up an impressive collection of Western art, not only on its walls, but also in an annual show in November that is open to the public.The club’s stark landscapes and portraits of lonesome cowboys are a source of pride for Ms. Davis, a Tucson native, who like her husband, Brett, is a flesh-and-blood ambassador for modern Western life.Both are accomplished horsemen and work cattle on the weekends at a friend’s ranch. Each is deadeye with a gun — a good skill to have when rattlesnakes make their way into your home. Both have spent many a night beneath the stars in a state where 85 percent of the land is public forest and park land, in a state trust or part of Native American reservations.“We are fortunate that much of the state still looks a lot like how those who originally came here found it,” Ms. Davis said.It’s not often you can balance the mythical with the mystical, but our trek three and a half hours north to Sedona did just that. As I have written before in an article about a journey to New Zealand: “No one will ever mistake me for Bear Grylls, and I know that the Wild is going to beat this Man every time.”Still, I have embraced the sport of hiking at the behest of my nature-loving wife and son, and I thought a stop to explore the town’s red rocks might satisfy our back-to-nature pangs as well as my desire for a hot tub, spa, bar and, well, civilization.Boning up in a hurry on a destination is so much easier these days with smartphones and YouTube. To prepare for our bicentennial trip, my siblings and I spent weeks in advance cracking the spines of the World Book encyclopedia. In the YouTube world, there is no such authority. You have to be discerning and/or gullible because the informational videos tell you Sedona is either a) a sacred place dotted by “vortexes,” or swirling centers of energy where healing and inspiration occur or b) J.F.K. Airport for intergalactic travelers buzzing with U.F.O.’s and those who want to see them.The Red Rock Scenic Byway, the gateway to the region, offers the first dose of this otherworldliness in the rock formations that line the roadways. You see what you want to see, mostly: Long-faced soldiers standing sentinel, layered pyramids and totem poles. Some, of course, are aptly named: Cathedral Rock, Bell Rock and Devil’s Bridge. It was late afternoon when we pulled into the Hilton Sedona Resort at Bell Rock and after making sure all my needs were met — hot tub, spa and bar all in place — the concierge gave us trail maps and sent us off on a short drive to Cathedral Rock for a sunset hike. It was perfect — a short but fairly steep ascent of its eastern slope. This was February and the state was in the midst of a cold spell, but we were comfortable in our fleeces, and watching the sun set was ethereal. We had climbed in near silence and remained that way. We were atop the trail for sunset and it was like watching the lights being dimmed on Mars.We got more ambitious the following morning, hiking the Courthouse Butte Loop, an invigorating four-mile route with a shifting landscape. There are juniper and agave and desert gardens. Sheer walls give way to spider web crevices. The thin layer of ice on the washes sparkled in the sunshine, and occasionally a covey of birds exploded from beneath the brush, adding cymbals to an otherwise easy listening classical movement.Alas, during our nighttime excursions, we failed to see a single unidentified flying object. But Sedona offers an excellent range of earthly delights, especially when it comes to filling the stomach after a soul-satisfying day on the rocks.Whenever I am in the Southwest, I stay with the native food — Mexican or Southwestern — since it is the one cuisine New York chefs have not been able to do authentically. Their mole is too chocolate-y. Their cheese too often congeals rather than melts into an enchilada.  The Coffee Pot is a must stop either pre- or posthike for breakfast or lunch. It boasts an expansive and inexpensive menu with 101 different kind of omelets (PB&J with banana anyone?) as well as a full range of diner food and my beloved Mexican dishes. Their enchiladas were a perfectly blend of cheese and chicken smothered (not soaked) in a savory red sauce. The Javelina Cantina won us over with their fajitas and a tavern-style friendliness. For true foodies, the Elote Café is a must stop. The chef and owner Jeff Smedstad’s travels across Oaxaca, Veracruz and Puebla pay off in an assortment of entrees like the chicken chilaquiles (smoked chicken and tortillas simmered in guajillo sauce) and a vegetable relleno with seared vegetables and apples, pecans, pumpkin seeds and pepita crema. (Be ready to stand in line, though, the Elote Café does not accept reservations.)All week, I had been worried about our Grand Canyon excursion. I felt that I was cheating the whole family. Did a day trip really do it justice? The summer rafting trips through the canyon on the Colorado River are highly recommended, but they are booked through 2019. Besides, it was winter. Another option, riding a mule down to the bottom and back, was as appetizing as mountain oysters for Jack and Mary.I need not have worried. It was Mary who suggested I book a trip through one of the more famous Arizona brands, Pink Jeep Tours, a company that, since 1960, has been zipping people around on- and off-road in, yes, pink jeeps. It was well worth the $494 price tag for all three of us. Our guide, Jeff Dana, picked us up at our hotel in a Mercedes coach at 7:30 a.m. and was nothing but informative and funny right up to returning us at 4:45 p.m. There were 10 of us altogether and Mr. Dana was a true pro, with insightful patter on everything, including the history and customs of the Navajos, whose land we were crossing on our 90-minute drive to the star attraction.Once at the canyon, Mr. Dana’s storytelling put us alongside Captain García López de Cárdenas and his Spanish soldiers, relying on Hopi guides and stumbling upon the canyon when they were searching for the Seven Cities of Gold. Mr. Dana made harrowing and concrete the challenges that Army Maj. John Wesley Powell faced as he led his expedition in 1869. Mr. Dana explained the canyon’s geology and timeline and where it fit in Native American culture and lore. He not only knew what he was talking about, but his passion for history and nature was genuine: He spoke of his own experiences hiking down the canyon and camping at the bottom.The Grand Canyon itself does not disappoint. There are the facts: 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide and over a mile deep. Then there is the sheer awe that washes over you. Standing on its lip, it looks like God’s footprint. It well could be. Some of the rocks along its walls are nearly 2 billion years old. Late in the morning, the faded hues of red and beige and orange at first looked freshly hand-drawn rather than chiseled over time. In the early afternoon, the walls morphed into deeper reds and more gilded golds. Later still, blues blended with purples and greens. For nearly six hours, we drifted from lookout point to lookout point never getting bored with what we were seeing. We took a few of the requisite photographs, but mostly we each withdrew into ourselves. Mary and I stole glances at Jack, who took it all in with a focus usually reserved for his epic Fortnite battles.We were quiet, serene even. This was a sacred place and I was fortunate to be sharing it for the first time with my family. We had been taken out of our worlds. We were discovering that we liked to discover things together.    An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a video game played by the writer's son. It is Fortnite, not Fortnight."

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Here’s what you need to know:• Britain faces an agonizing decision: How should it model its future ties with the European Union?Some think the country should be like Norway, outside the E.U. but tightly bound to the bloc’s high social and economic standards. Others want the country to break free, cut taxes and regulations and transform itself into a European version of Singapore.The stakes are high for Britain’s economy. Brexit plans have already prompted thousands of Europeans to return to the Continent, forcing British employers to compete for a diminishing pool of workers.Theresa May, above, is expected to address the House of Commons on Monday over new trade deals._____• Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, called President Trump on Sunday to thank him for the C.I.A.’s help in disrupting an Islamic State attack in St. Petersburg.In rare words of praise for the C.I.A., Mr. Putin said the agency had provided information that “helped detain terrorists planning explosions.”Meanwhile, in Washington, a lawyer for Mr. Trump accused Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in U.S. elections, of illegally obtaining Trump transition emails, the latest in the mounting attacks on the investigation into Russian election meddling.Above, Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump at a summit in Vietnam, in November._____• The lights went out at the world’s busiest airport.Passengers from around the world were stranded at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after a power failure on Sunday. Many were held on the tarmac for hours without explanation.Expect snarls to ripple through the air traffic system._____• A Times investigation has brought to light a shadowy Pentagon program — parts of it remain classified — that since 2007 has investigated reports of unidentified flying objects.One fighter pilot told us about a strange encounter in 2004 with a whitish, oval U.F.O. that “accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen,” and left him “pretty weirded out.”In less surprising political news, President Trump expects to sign the Republican tax bill this week. He has called it a Christmas present for the entire nation, but the fine print reveals some will get nicer gifts than others._____“An economic agent on behalf of North Korea.”The Australian federal police said Chan Han Choi, a naturalized citizen living in Sydney, had been arrested on charges of trying to help North Korea sell its missile parts and other military technology to “international entities.”North Korea has been accelerating its nuclear and missile tests. Here’s what we know about the scientists, above, who serve the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.Last week, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson offered tantalizing details about how the U.S. would race inside North Korea to seize its nuclear weapons in the event of a collapse._____• A $500 million yacht, a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting and the $300 million chateau above.These are among the impulse buys of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne, who happens to be preaching fiscal austerity and leading a crackdown on corruption.The purchase of Chateau Louis XIV “is a severe blow to that image,” one analyst said. [Lire en français.]• “The Last Jedi” made the jump to box office hyperspace, selling $450 million in tickets worldwide on its opening weekend.The film’s stars — including, above, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill — recently discussed new relationships, the joys of villainy and those porgs with our reporter.• Uber secretly spied on key executives, drivers and employees at rival ride-hailing firms in multiple countries, according to a letter made public in a U.S. federal court.• The computer chip industry is being shaken up by an aggressive set of chief executives who are pushing big acquisitions, slashing costs and driving up profits.• Here’s a snapshot of global markets.• In South Africa, disputes are delaying the vote to elect a leader to succeed President Jacob Zuma, whose administration has been plagued with scandals.

[The New York Times]• In Pakistan, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for an assault on a church in Quetta that left at least eight dead and 30 injured, raising concerns about the security of the country’s Christians. [The New York Times]• A French sailor circumnavigated the globe in 42 days and 16 hours, beating the previous world record by more than six days. [BBC]Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.• Attention holiday travelers: Here are 10 places around the world that really know how to celebrate Christmas, including Prague, Zurich and Copenhagen.• What to cook this week: Our food editor, Sam Sifton, suggests chicken adobo, Russian honey cake and more.• For five months, The New York Times tracked 21 public hospitals in Venezuela, where doctors are seeing record numbers of children with severe malnutrition. Hundreds have died.• John Rutter’s carols are sung across the English-speaking world, but their tuneful accessibility has kept him from a place in the pantheon of serious composers.• In memoriam: Marina Popovich, a test pilot who broke more than 100 flying records and was the first Soviet woman to break the sound barrier; and Aline Griffith, a former model from New York who transformed herself into a dressed-to-kill, self-proclaimed spy and Spanish countess.• And our pop critics collected notable new music, including Lin-Manuel Miranda’s collaboration with the Decemberists and a Thelonious Monk reissue.On Dec. 18, 1941, less than two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Sunday editor for The Times sent a memo to the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger.It said: “We ought to proceed with the puzzle, especially in view of the fact it is possible there will now be bleak blackout hours — or if not that then certainly a need for relaxation of some kind or other.”That’s how a time of national grief helped lead to one of The Times’s most joyful and beloved features. The crossword puzzle debuted some two months later as a weekly feature in the Sunday magazine.The editor at the time, Margaret Farrar, followed a simple rule: good manners. She refused to allow unpleasant or impolite language — a rule that’s still followed by The Times’s current crossword editor, Will Shortz.Nowadays, we like to think of our crossword puzzle as the form’s gold standard.But The Times didn’t always hold crosswords in high regard. In 1924, a Times opinion column called the completion of crosswords a “sinful waste.”Crossword solvers, the column claimed, “get nothing out of it except a primitive sort of mental exercise.”Many of us would disagree._____This briefing was prepared for the European morning and is updated online.

5a46c6c97c459f246b63d3cd,2017: Our Reporters Reflect on Covering Washington and Politics,2017-12-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/us/politics/covering-washington-politics.html,The New York Times,"It would be an understatement to say that 2017 was one of the most exciting years in American politics in decades. News from Washington dominated headlines and kept New York Times reporters and editors starting early and working late. Nearly two-thirds of The Times’s most-read articles pertained to politics.Throughout the year, our reporters, photographers and editors shared their reflections with Times Insider on how they covered some of the biggest stories — and some of the more modest scoops, as well. Here is a collection of those tales and our journalists’ recounting of how they unfolded.A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees and others who were trapped at airports across the United States after President Trump signed an executive order that sought to keep many foreigners from entering the country, leading to chaotic scenes worldwide.At first I couldn’t find the lawyers. I walked back and forth, texting Julie Kornfeld from the International Refugee Assistance Project, “Where are you I’m at door 2.” She wrote back, “We r near arrivals.” I was so tired, I hadn’t even realized I was looking for them in the departures area.The arrivals hall at Terminal 4 was eerily quiet. There was a woman selling Dunkin’ Donuts coffee, but the trays in the glass case were bare of food. It would be hours before the doughnuts and muffins arrived. There were a few drowsy passengers. And there was an active if exhausted legal team of three attorneys.— Nicholas Kulish, Three Pens, a Notebook and Questions: Inside a Late-Night Assignment (February 3)The acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, had ordered government lawyers not to defend in court Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration.Shortly after 9, we walked into Upper Press, the suite of offices where the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, works. He was standing next to a desk where an assistant had her finger poised over a keyboard. Scanning the text on his iPhone one last time, he told the aide to hit “send.”“We just fired the attorney general,” Mr. Spicer said matter-of-factly, turning to Maggie and me.— Mark Landler, Our White House Reporters Recall Their Most Vivid Moments of Trump’s First 100 Days (April 28)While at President Trump’s Florida club, the president and his aides coordinated their response to a North Korean missile test. They did not bother to retire to a secure location. No sooner had I lifted fork to mouth than an email popped up on my phone: “URGENT 9:30 P.M. CALL TIME.” It was 9:27 p.m. The lid, evidently, was off.I rushed to rejoin Mr. Trump’s press pool and we piled into S.U.V.s that raced to Mar-a-Lago. On the way, White House sources told me that the president had abruptly decided to join Mr. Abe in a public statement about a missile launch by North Korea that day. Earlier, Mr. Trump had refused to say a word about the test, but this was a president who had already developed a reputation for sudden reversals.— Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Our White House Reporters Recall Their Most Vivid Moments of Trump’s First 100 Days (April 28)The United States has been trying to sabotage North Korea’s missile program. Mr. Trump must decide what to do next.The launches were failing too often.That was the topic of the conversation I was having one day late last spring with Bill Broad, one of The Times’s premier science writers. Just about every time the North Koreans tried to launch an advanced missile, it seemed to end up in the ocean seconds later. Maybe it was bad luck, we said to each other, or bad parts, or bad welding. After all, the North Koreans are not known for quality control. Or maybe something else was going on.— David E. Sanger, A Eureka Moment for Two Times Reporters: North Korea’s Missile Launches Were Failing Too Often (March 6)With crucial staff positions unfilled and no on-site first lady at the time, the White House had to try to organize the most elaborate and heavily scrutinized public event of the year.I first became interested in the Easter Egg Roll after a colleague alerted me to another quiet drama unfolding on Twitter: The wood products manufacturer that makes the commemorative eggs had been using the platform to nudge Mr. Trump to submit an order for the Egg Roll before he missed the production deadline.Intrigued, I began calling sources who might know something about the planning of the event. Many professed ignorance and even some alarm about whether Mr. Trump would hold the Easter Egg Roll at all; others told me plans were underway but the event would be scaled back — to about 20,000 attendees from nearly twice that many last year.It seemed an apt metaphor for a White House plagued with understaffing and disorganization from the start.— Julie Hirschfeld Davis, My Own Private Easter Egg-Gate (April 15)The House voted on a revised health care bill that would have repealed and replaced major parts of the Affordable Care Act.Unlike in the verbal tally in the Senate, though, the House vote is displayed on four scoreboard-like panels inside the chamber. And the panels aren’t visible on C-SPAN. It was time to do some in-person research.I learned the rules of the House chamber. We could bring laptops, and there would be internet access. But the House press gallery forbids photography; we would have to type out descriptions of any visuals we wanted to capture. We also faced another challenge: hand-entering 431 votes split among four wall-size screens. Worse, the press seats were beneath the screens, making them hard to see. Several ill-placed wall lamps added to the difficulty. And once the voting period ended, the screens turned off, and the vote tally disappeared.— Rachel Shorey, How We Beat the House — in Tallying the Health Care Vote (May 8)Mr. Trump abruptly fired James B. Comey, who was leading an investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s advisers colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.Something was clearly going on. After a few minutes, Mr. Spicer opened the door and announced to me and the half dozen other reporters who were nervously waiting that something important would be in our inboxes momentarily.NBC’s Hallie Jackson pushed him to share more as we all checked our email and saw nothing. Mr. Spicer pointed to ABC’s Jon Karl.“It’s your question from the briefing,” he said, smiling.“Comey?” Mr. Karl offered, recalling that he had asked Mr. Spicer whether the president still had confidence in the F.B.I. director.Mr. Spicer smiled broadly and put his finger on his nose. — Michael D. Shear, Breaking the Comey News, One Sentence at a Time (May 10)Mr. Comey said that the president had tried to derail an investigation into an adviser and that he had lied about and defamed Mr. Comey.With hearings like this one, I have to preconceive of the scene. I make a layout in my mind of everything that’s going to happen: the moment he arrives, the moment he sits down, the moment he raises his hand to be sworn in. And I set up my cameras to capture all those moments, to be fired remotely, all at the same time. (When I fired the picture of Mr. Comey surrounded by the press, I had the three other cameras firing too.)I put my fourth camera up on a full-length monopod and held it as high as I could. I pre-focused the shot ahead of time, and spent a little time making sure the image would be sharp. And, as more people arrived, I thought, “There’s no way I can’t put all these photographers into the foreground of the picture.” So I took three or four steps back and zoomed out a bit.— Doug Mills, A Photo of James Comey Takes the Internet by Storm (June 9)Mr. Trump said that Western civilization was at risk of decline, bringing a message about “radical Islamic terrorism” and “the creep of government bureaucracy” to Warsaw.Usually, overseas presidential trips are elaborately choreographed affairs weeks or months in the making, with pre-baked schedules to match. But that afternoon, just five hours before Mr. Trump disembarked, I finally received an email from the White House informing me of his schedule — and my own — for the next day. It was the latest I could ever recall getting such information.But the Trump White House eschews many of the protocols and procedures that usually surround a president, and advance warning for the press about Mr. Trump’s movements and plans can be difficult to come by. For instance, there was a mention of a “news event” with President Andrzej Duda of Poland, but it would not become clear until the next morning whether Mr. Trump planned to take any questions.— Julie Hirschfeld Davis, When You’re Traveling With Trump, Be Ready for the Unexpected (July 10)The president also said in an interview that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, would cross a red line if he delved into Trump family finances unrelated to Russia.Whatever else he is, Mr. Trump is a news machine. He generates headlines every time he speaks. He has made the White House press corps a growth industry. With other presidents, we sometimes struggled to find nuggets of news in an interview; with Mr. Trump we were overwhelmed. After the session on Wednesday, I have now interviewed seven presidents — some in office, some after they left — and with Mr. Trump the experience is strikingly different in almost every respect.— Peter Baker, The New Presidential Interview (July 24)The debate over what the president meant effectively consumed Twitter — or at least a certain segment of it.That tweet came on one of the few nights I left the office early, shortly before midnight, so I got the alert while I was driving home. I sat in my driveway for at least 20 minutes, waiting for Mr. Trump to either add to the covfefe tweet or delete it. (Most of us on the Washington bureau staff get Twitter alerts on our phones both when he tweets and when he deletes the tweets.) When he didn’t, I became worried that something had happened to him. Had he fallen asleep? Did he have a heart attack? Was he called down to the SitRoom? It was weird.— Lara Jakes, On the Night News Desk When Trump’s Tweeting Starts (December 8)The president’s announcement, made on Twitter, blindsided the Pentagon and congressional Republican leaders and thrilled members of his conservative base.I suspect that in years to come, when I am recounting what it was like to be a Pentagon correspondent, I will remember far more the combination of hurt and defiance in the voice of a transgender American service member when I asked him how it felt to wake up Wednesday morning to a tweet from President Trump that he was no longer welcome in this country’s all-volunteer military.— Helene Cooper, A Pentagon Correspondent Keeps Sight of the Person Inside the Uniform (July 30)The White House press secretary is more understated than her predecessor, Sean Spicer, but she still speaks for a president at war with the news media.It was Ms. Sanders’s final meeting before the West Wing closed for a summer renovation, and her office was almost bare. A lone houseplant, a holdover from the Obama administration, drooped from a high shelf. “I’ve kept it alive until the last month and now it’s just fallen apart,” she told me.Was that a metaphor? She laughed. “No, the plant — it just didn’t make it.”— Michael M. Grynbaum, Just Months Later, Another Press Secretary Profile (August 9)A Times investigation found that infiltration efforts were broader than previously disclosed and that state and federal agencies have conducted few forensic inquiries.In fact, we discovered that precious little research had been conducted, the result of legal limits on the authority of intelligence agencies to address domestic issues and states’ historic reluctance to permit federal oversight of elections.Michael Wines, who covers election issues for the Times, said that what stood out to him was the vulnerability of the nation’s vast Rube Goldberg election system. Elections, he explained, “are run by understaffed, underfinanced and sometimes undertrained local officials, serviced by outside contractors who may or may not be well vetted, conducted with equipment and software that may or may not be secure.”And Matthew Rosenberg, who covers national security issues for the Times, discovered that the intelligence community’s conclusion — that the Election Day vote was not hacked — was extremely limited in scope.I started calling around to the election security and technology experts who had witnessed some of the troubles that cropped up on Election Day. I found that they, too, were still searching for answers and were befuddled by the lack of any substantial investigation.— Nicole Perlroth, In Election Interference, It’s What Reporters Didn’t Find That Matters (September 1)The calendar of Scott Pruitt, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, showed fine dining with officials from companies he regulates but few meetings with environmentalists.The New York Times had filed a Freedom of Information request for Mr. Pruitt’s calendar, with no response from the agency. But the nonprofit group American Oversight sued the E.P.A. over its slow response to a similar request it had filed and received a copy, which it provided to The Times.Lisa covers the E.P.A. for The Times. I write about regulatory policy and lobbying. We spent much of the weekend reading through Mr. Pruitt’s calendar.Page after page showed Mr. Pruitt holding meetings with lobbyists and top executives from automobile manufacturers; oil industry giants; pork and soybean farmers; coal mining companies; chemical companies; coal-burning electric utilities; conservative media outlets; Republican lawmakers; even Steve Bannon and Ivanka Trump (they had a half-hour each, in successive meetings, on the same day, before Mr. Trump’s decision on the Paris climate agreement).— Eric Lipton, Deep in 316-Page E.P.A. Doc, Reporter Finds Hint of Unexpected Turn in History (October 5)Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona was in political peril ahead of the 2018 midterms, but he said he had no regrets in taking on Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake has since announced that he would not run for re-election next year.What I remember most about Mr. Flake that day was his mood. He was not defiant, as he would later be in his Senate floor speech. Rather, he was deeply reflective; in retrospect, it seems clear he knew even then that his political career was over.— Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Our Journalists Share Their Most Memorable Interviews of 2017 (December 18)The shadowy program began in 2007 and was largely funded at the request of Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, who was the majority leader at the time and who has had a longtime interest in space phenomena.So how does a story on U.F.O.s get into The New York Times? Not easily, and only after a great deal of vetting, I assure you.— Ralph Blumenthal, On the Trail of a Secret Pentagon U.F.O. Program (December 18)"

We couldn’t figure out what it was.”But he added that he believed it was impossible “to have space people from other planets or other stars” come to Earth.While he didn’t believe they could visit us, Mr. Carter did record a message for “possible unknown civilizations in the galaxies” as president. It was part of the golden record placed in the Voyager in August 1977.He said it represented “our hope and our determination, our good will in the vast and awesome universe.”Karen Zraick contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

5b3f02a6068401528a2b9f52,The Rise of the Stressed-Out Urban Camper,2018-07-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/nyregion/the-rise-of-the-stressed-out-urban-camper.html,The New York Times,"It was opening weekend for glamping on Governors Island, and things were a bit rocky. First, there were the rocks. Thanks to weeks of alternating torrential rain and baking sun, the grass hadn’t come in, creating a lunar landscape around the tents. Then the liquor license hadn’t come through, leaving the beautiful new wooden bar high and dry. Finally, there was the throbbing bass of house music coming from the raucous Pinknic rosé festival on an adjacent plot of land.But once the music stopped at 9:30 and the blazing sun dipped behind the Jersey City skyline, the magic began.Thousands of lights in Lower Manhattan twinkled like constellations, and the glowing green Statue of Liberty waved goodbye as hordes of wine-buzzed, pastel-clad revelers raced for the last ferry home.The glampers were alone.“The views are fantastic,” said Damon Willmott, a Park Sloper who had booked two tents for his family of four. “It’s great somebody’s done this in New York.” The Willmotts go camping often, but driving outside the city and packing up all that gear adds a level of difficulty and stress. After the eight-minute ferry ride to their campsite, they simply plopped down their bags, turned off their phones and played a game of Scrabble. Mr. Willmott smiled and nodded. “It felt good to disconnect.”Joining the Willmotts at Collective Retreats on the island’s south end were scores of other campers in 37 tents ranging in price from $220 to $650 ($75 tents are available on Tuesday nights, and some tents go for as much as $850, depending on demand). Some were roasting marshmallows in the fire pit, some eating $120 prix fix meals in the permanent Three Peaks lodge; others played beanbag toss.As it grew later, glampers wandered off to bed (not sleeping bags, but actual beds), and their white tents lit up one by one, triangles incandescent against the dark harbor. The crowd was diverse: a family of eight from Pennsylvania whose matriarch had grown up on Governors Island as an Army brat; a lesbian couple both originally from New Jersey who had never camped before; another couple from Montreal. But most were from New York City.“It’s a nice way to explore a part of the city you might not otherwise visit,” said Dawn Hood, a first-time camper from Inwood. “I’m always looking to get into something new.” Even if that something new is just plain nature.There was birdsong in the air, and the gentle lapping of the waves, but there was no mistaking this for a camp in the Adirondacks. Every 15 minutes the Staten Island Ferry glided by, and airplanes descended steadily toward Newark Airport. It wasn’t perfect nature, but for Ms. Hood and the other glampers, it was enough to let them slip into a collective state of solitude.Setting up camp on the edges of the city itself or just outside its limits, New Yorkers are seeking a way out. Looking to escape their screens, traffic, messed-up subways, their bosses, and national politics, many are finding solace in a nearby tent or cabin.According to a report by Kampgrounds of America, 2.6 million more American households camped last year than in 2016. A major reason was to relieve stress. Nearly all millennials surveyed (93 percent) said they would like to try camping this year, many gravitating toward glamping.New Yorkers are no different. Those who might have never camped five years ago are heading into the wild. But this time with ready-made tents with beds inside.Hard-core campers may scoff at glamping (“glamour camping,” that is, or wimping, as it’s sometimes called), and even glamping outfitters dislike the term. But most people agree getting back to nature — no matter how comfortable — is better than not going at all. Recent studies in Finland show that walking as little as 20 minutes in the woods helps significantly reduce stress. Forest bathing, popular in Japan, has been known to reduce stress as well and has been catching on here and in other countries.“Whatever’s going to help you commune with nature and have a great experience, I’m all for it,” said Kevin Rosenberg, who runs Gear to Go Outfitters, an online equipment-rental and guide service.Mr. Rosenberg, who spent years in the military, has extensive survival training and employs veterans as guides, does not glamp. When he camps, he goes deep into the wilderness without an air mattress or a stove. But he doesn’t look down on the glampers.“Protecting the environment is very important to me,” said Mr. Rosenberg, who once ran his company out of a Brooklyn storefront but now lives upstate. “The more people bond with nature, the more they want to protect it. Whatever form it takes, it’s fine with me as long as what they’re doing is responsible. You might as well be comfortable and enjoy it.”A number of New York companies have recently emerged to make the trek into the outdoors as seamless as possible: Collective Retreats, Tentrr, Getaway and Terra Glamping all provide cushy accommodations to help a growing wave of indoorsy people become outdoorsy.Tentrr, for instance, was created with the New York apartment dweller in mind. “The person who doesn’t want to bring equipment, wants an amazing outdoor experience but doesn’t really know where to go,” said Baxter Townsend, public relations director at the company.Mike D’Agostino, a former investment banker who founded Tentrr three years ago after a series of disastrous personal camping trips, has it down to a science. Potential campers visit the website, note a series of preferences (for example: hike in, views, forest, fishing) and are matched with possible sites and hosts outside the city.Each campsite — all on private land — is equipped with a durable canvas tent on a raised platform with a memory foam mattress, a Brazilian hardwood table, a camp box for dry storage and benches. A camp toilet, Adirondack chairs, a fire ring, sun shower and 24/7 customer service are part of the package, which averages around $144 a night.For Mr. D’Agostino, the lightning-bolt moment came on a weekend camping trip with his wife at Stokes State Forest in New Jersey, crowded together with dozens of other campers.“We were literally across the car track from 40 people having a Wiccan full-moon party dressed in these white robes,” he said. At one point, a nude woman claiming to have seen a U.F.O. ran through their campsite. “We thought, We have to get out of here.” They left early the next morning to head back to Manhattan and saw a beautiful farm on the side of the road. “I said to my wife, ‘Imagine if we could go camping there.’ ”Cue the lightning bolt.Tentrr currently has 500 campsites throughout the Northeast, many of them on struggling farms that can use the extra income. (The company takes a 20 percent commission on every campsite reserved.)Nearly half of those using the service have never been camping before, Mr. D’Agostino said. But even experienced campers have taken to Tentrr.Kevin Simonson, a Brooklynite who runs a digital marketing firm, has hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and experienced his fair share of backcountry camping. His girlfriend, Katie Kapler, however, had never been camping, and Mr. Simonson didn’t want to scare her off.“I looked at Tentrr as training wheels,” said Ms. Kapler, the founder of CourseHorse, an internet marketplace for classes. The couple have now used Tentrr three times — with their dog, Ollie, who had never been off leash before and has now encountered deer up close. “He was like, ‘What is this sensation? Oh, it’s freedom!’” Ms. Kapler said.Even the most serious campers have to start somewhere. Growing up on Long Island, Gear to Go’s Mr. Rosenberg never hiked or camped — nor had anyone he knew. It wasn’t until he joined the R.O.T.C. that he slept under the stars for the first time.His motto is to never sell anything to a camper that is unnecessary, like a $3 enamel camping mug with a new logo on it that sells for $20, or a “repurposed antique” hatchet with a freshly painted handle at double the price of a regular hatchet.He said he finds it amusing that so many young men feel the need to take a hatchet camping. “I’ve never even carried a hatchet into the woods,” he said, laughing. “But God bless them.”The cliché of the bearded urban lumberjack throwing hatchets in a bar instead of darts may come from a more ominous place than simple trendiness. Zach Denes, the manager of Hatchet Outdoor Supply Company on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, said he believes the New York City camping bug is spreading thanks to President Trump’s stance on national parks, his push for more mining and drilling and concessions to polluting corporations.“I think it’s a backlash,” Mr. Denes said. “It’s becoming much more hip to camp, to hike, especially around here in Brooklyn. Our current administration is boosting that for everybody.”There are plenty of camping options around the city. There is Terra Glamping, an upscale glamping company that’s not afraid to use the G-word.It was one of two pilot glamping programs at Fort Tilden in the Rockaways and is one of several vendors submitting proposals to return next summer. The company is also considering glamping programs at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and at Coney Island. “We can set our tents up anywhere,” said Rebecca Martin, the company’s founder. Most are up in Kingston at the Hutton Brickyards on the Hudson, and start at $250 a night.Amenities include memory foam mattresses, down comforters, lanterns, Turkish towels and robes, luxury bath products — and pastries in the morning.“Personally I hate camping and getting in a sleeping bag on the ground,” Ms. Martin said.Collective Governors Island, one of the higher-end glamping experiences in the area, offers private bathrooms as big as a Manhattan apartment, custom-made furniture, 1,500-thread-count sheets, housekeeping and three meals a day.Camp Rockaway offered a no-frills glamping experience at Fort Tilden in Queens last autumn; it will be setting up a dozen tents this year in the courtyard of the art deco Riis Bathhouse in Rockaway through Halloween. Though prices at that site hover around $200 a night, the company is also applying for space at Fort Tilden again, to set up lower-end accommodations starting at $49.“We’re trying to take the glam out of glamping,” said Kent Johnson, who runs the company. He said the big selling point was the communal campfire, where people from all walks of life can roast marshmallows and chat. “It’s really an antidote to cellphone addiction.”Not all back-to-nature experiences have to do with spending time with other people. A couple of years ago, a Harvard Business School graduate named Jon Staff was growing weary of the internet start-up life. He and his friend Pete Davis were seeking an escape from their hectic lives in Boston.“We were tired of the city, tired of email, our friends, of everything,” said Mr. Staff, who now lives in Carroll Gardens. “We were burned out and wanted to go to the woods. We couldn’t afford a vacation far away and thought maybe we could build a tiny house and stick it in the woods where we could escape.” Having grown up in Minnesota, where small cabins are common, Mr. Staff didn’t think it was exactly a new concept. But the personal escape soon became his latest start-up — Getaway.The company builds modern-looking one-room cabins, typically around 160 square feet, with a lock box for cellphones, as well as a larder of basic provisions like pasta, sauce and popcorn. There’s also a list of things to do, like watch the constellations slowly turn. There’s a comfortable bed, a stove and running water, a fire pit and a few books to read.All the houses have land lines for emergencies, but guests have used the phones in less desperate situations. “We would get all these calls,” Mr. Staff said. “‘We got in the house. It’s beautiful. Can you please send someone over to make the campfire?’” So Getaway now provides step-by-step instructions for starting a fire.Getaway now has 75 tiny houses in the Northeast, outside of New York, Boston and Washington, D.C. Mr. Staff said he got a letter recently from a woman who hated her job, whose husband hated his job, who said she cries a lot. Two days in the tiny house, she said, had helped them escape their worries.“We’re not solving that problem and we don’t pretend to,” said Mr. Staff. “But the idea is that you can literally pull the rip cord and go to the woods and not have to think about anything.”At the moment there are 13 Getaway houses outside New York, all in the Catskills, but Mr. Staff is working on expanding. Last summer, Getaway took part in a pilot project at Staten Island’s Fort Wadsworth, setting up three houses that were all booked.The National Park Service, which runs Fort Wadsworth, said it is expanding the offerings for campers to try to appeal to all kinds of visitors. The tiny Getaway houses were set up on USS North Carolina Road, at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, amid black locust trees, with beach access and a view of the harbor.Offerings this coming summer might include tiny houses again, tents or glamping, said Emina Sendich, deputy superintendent of Gateway National Recreation Area. “The public doesn’t realize what a gem this place is,” she said. On a recent visit, humans were joined by a possum, a woodpecker, deer and a woodchuck.“I’ve spent the night down here and you really do feel like you’re out there and you’re camping,” she said. “You’ve got the campfire going. You’re barbecuing. You’ve got your family with you.”Fort Wadsworth is part of Gateway National Park, which also includes Fort Tilden, as well as Sandy Hook in New Jersey and Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. Camping has been permitted at Fort Wadsworth since 2012, and regular campsites can be reserved for $30 a night. They attract international tourists looking for affordable travel options as well as first-time campers who grew up in New York City.“We get lots of local people camping,” said Brian Feeney, the park’s Staten Island unit manager. “One woman said to me, ‘It’s my first time, so if it doesn’t work out I’m going home tonight.’” He smiled and shrugged, staring out at New York Harbor, the skyline in the distance. “You can’t do that at Yosemite.”"

Here’s what you need to know:• “An economic agent on behalf of North Korea.”Australian federal police said Chan Han Choi, 59, a naturalized citizen living in Sydney’s suburbs, had been arrested on charges of trying to help North Korea sell its missile parts and other military technology to “international entities” that were not further identified.North Korea, which has become adept at circumventing international sanctions, has been accelerating its nuclear and missile tests. Here’s what we know about the “nuclear duo” and the “missile quartet” — that is, the scientists who serve the leader, Kim Jong-un.The U.S. stance on talks with the North is back to a unified insistence on preconditions: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a U-turn after a brief effort at conciliation._____• In South Africa, a turning point for the African National Congress.In a meeting that isn’t exactly going smoothly, members are choosing a new party leader to succeed Jacob Zuma. The winner is expected to follow Mr. Zuma as the country’s president in 2019.South Africa’s head of state since 2009, Mr. Zuma has been mired in a series of personal and political scandals that have tarred Nelson Mandela’s once heroic liberation movement._____• A Times investigation has brought to light a shadowy Pentagon program — parts of it remain classified — that since 2007 has investigated reports of unidentified flying objects. One fighter pilot told us about a strange encounter in 2004 with a whitish, oval U.F.O. that “accelerated like nothing I’ve ever seen,” and left him “pretty weirded out.”In less surprising political news, President Trump expects to sign the Republican tax bill this week. He has called it a Christmas present for the entire nation, but the fine print reveals some will get nicer gifts than others.His administration sought to play down a report that officials at a top U.S. health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were told to avoid using seven words, including “fetus” and “transgender.”_____• A promising vaccine for dengue fever is in jeopardy after the Philippines suspended it, amid widespread fears about its safety and growing public anger over its use in 830,000 schoolchildren.The French drugmaker, Sanofi, has come under fire for discounting early warnings that its vaccine could put some people at heightened risk of a severe form of the disease.Researchers fear the stumble could stoke mistrust in vaccines around the globe._____• The lights went out at the world’s busiest airport.Passengers from around the world waited, held on the tarmac for four, five, six hours — without explanation. Expect snarls to ripple through the air traffic system._____• A $500 million yacht, a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting and the $300 million chateau above.These are among the impulse buys of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the Saudi throne, who happens to be preaching fiscal austerity and leading a crackdown on corruption in the Saudi elite.The purchase of Chateau Louis XIV, as pieced together through interviews and documents by The Times, “is a severe blow to that image,” one analyst said._____• “The Last Jedi” made the jump to box office hyperspace, selling $450 million in tickets worldwide on its opening weekend and affirming Disney’s strategy for rebooting the 40-year-old franchise.The film’s stars — including, above, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill — recently discussed new relationships, the joys of villainy and those porgs with our reporter.• Uber secretly spied on key executives, drivers and employees at rival ride-hailing firms as part of an intelligence-gathering operation in multiple countries, according to a letter made public in a U.S. federal court.•  Here’s a snapshot of global markets.• In Indonesia, as estimated 80,000 protesters marched against the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the latest show of support for Palestinians in the world’s most populous Muslim nation.

59a7fa677c459f246b621055,‘Close Encounters’ Was When the Movies Got New-Age Religion,2017-08-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/arts/movie-close-encounters-of-the-third-kind-anniversary.html,The New York Times,"The French director François Truffaut once said that “when a film achieves a certain success, it becomes a sociological event.” Such was the case with Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” a movie in which Truffaut himself appeared as a scientist exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and which was initially greeted with something like religious awe.“Close Encounters” will mark its 40th anniversary with appropriate fanfare. In addition to a presentation at the Venice Film Festival on Thursday, the movie, newly remastered and digitally restored, opens on Friday for a special weeklong run in theaters across the country. (In New York, these include the AMC Lincoln Square, AMC Empire and Regal Union Square.)The pièce de résistance is the open-air screening on Saturday at the base of Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming. The location is the setting of the film’s finale, and those who make the trek for the screening, which is sponsored by Alamo Drafthouse theaters and the cable station Syfy, will be recapitulating that of its protagonist, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a Midwestern telephone lineman redeemed and ultimately beatified by his belief in U.F.O.s.Like “Star Wars,” which had its premiere approximately half a year before “Close Encounters,” Mr. Spielberg’s film drew on the science-fiction movies and TV shows of its director’s childhood. But where “Star Wars” transported viewers to a distant galaxy, “Close Encounters” brought representatives of that galaxy to Earth — more specifically suburban Middle America. “Close Encounters” revived the Cold War space-invader genre with a difference. Humans had previously been menaced by bloodsucking carrots or brain-eating Martians; in “Close Encounters,” the new extraterrestrials were positively angelic.On its release in 1977, The New Republic characterized the movie, which was Mr. Spielberg’s follow-up to “Jaws,” as “an event in the history of faith.” Writing in The New York Times, the Catholic priest and sociologist Andrew M. Greeley extolled the movie’s sense of religious wonder. The conservative Christian publication Today’s Student, which had a university following, went even further in asserting that “nothing has ever approached the rapture and enchantment” of the movie’s closing scenes, adding that its “grand scale” and “magnitude” approached the work of God.Others were less ecstatic. “Who is Spielberg to define religion for us?” asked New York magazine’s film critic Molly Haskell. (The author of a recent monograph on Mr. Spielberg, Ms. Haskell has grown more appreciative of the filmmaker if not the film.)The Times critic Vincent Canby called the film “the best — the most elaborate — 1950s science fiction movie ever made” but, noting Mr. Spielberg’s attempt at “both scientific and theological importance,” added, “That might have been fascinating if I’d had a chance to understand it.”And writing in the Catholic journal Commonweal, the critic Colin L. Westerbeck Jr. saw “Close Encounters” as the epitome of New Age mysticism “made out of, and for, our touchy-feely culture — the culture of group therapy and group grope, of EST, TM, and (close) encounter therapy.”However universal, “Close Encounters” was very much a generational statement. Roy’s faith in the extraterrestrials inspires him to drop out, grow a beard and rebel against an official culture of lies. His female counterpart, Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), is already something of a hippie, a solitary artist living alone with her young son (Cary Guffey) on an isolated farm.Julia Phillips, one of the movie’s producers, saw “Close Encounters” as something akin to “Easy Rider.” In her memoir “You’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,” she recounts the pitch she fancied herself delivering to Columbia’s head of production: “Anyone who has ever dropped acid and looked up at the sky for a while or smoked a joint and watched the Watergate hearings on TV is waiting for this movie.”In addition to touchy-feely mysticism and contact highs, “Close Encounters” articulated the post-Watergate mistrust of government. While the movie was in production, Mr. Spielberg told The Washington Post that he felt the American government was “sitting on an incredible compilation of information” regarding visitors from outer space. “In many ways, this movie is a cosmic Watergate,” he explained. “Hopefully people will experience something very much like a real U.F.O. experience.”Most profoundly perhaps, “Close Encounters” (which was in production during Jimmy Carter’s 1976 presidential campaign) expressed a yearning to be born again — as a child. Roy longs to escape adult responsibility. The film raises legitimate fears of losing one’s job, home, family and, in a powerfully poignant sequence, even one’s sanity. Yet the more Roy surrenders to extraterrestrial influence, the more infantile he becomes.As the movie reaches its climax, other adults — many of them scientists — are shown acting like children. Science itself is downgraded, as when the appearance of the extraterrestrials prompts one scientist to inform his colleagues, “It’s the first day of school, fellas,” or when another suggests that Albert Einstein might have been an alien.Mr. Spielberg is a master of popular culture whose forbears include Alfred Hitchcock (the arch-manipulator) and Walt Disney (the apostle of childhood innocence, but no less manipulative for all that). If “Jaws” was Mr. Spielberg’s Hitchcock film, “Close Encounters” channeled Disney. Interviewed by Rolling Stone at the time of the movie’s release, Mr. Spielberg credited “When You Wish Upon a Star” as his inspiration, citing “the feeling the song gave me when I was a kid listening to it,” presumably as the theme to the “Disneyland” TV show.A baby boomer like Mr. Spielberg, I too watched “Disneyland” as a child (and remember the excited feeling that in watching it I was in a mind-meld with every kid in America). My first experience of “Close Encounters” came several months into its opening run, waiting in line at the neighborhood movie-house on East 86th Street in Manhattan. As memorable as the movie itself was the spectacle of patrons exiting the theater. Many appeared to be in tears.“Close Encounters” would not have the same effect on me, but it did teach me something about the power of the film medium. The climactic light show is a drama of cinematic communication (and communion) in which nothing (and everything) is communicated — at least on the big screen. I cannot imagine a comparable “Close Encounters” seen on a laptop."
58eedbb37c459f24986d9f0c,Review: Derek DelGaudio Sets Himself Apart From the Abracadabra Crowd,2017-04-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/theater/in-and-of-itself-derek-delgaudio.html,The New York Times,"Derek DelGaudio, the creator and star of the stealthily entrancing solo show “In & Of Itself,” is a magician, a raconteur, a Conceptual artist and conceivably a mind reader. He is also, as he’ll tell you, a wolf, a dog, a son, an orphan and “more than just an elephant.”But here’s the real question: Who are you?Enter the lobby of the Daryl Roth Theater, and hundreds of cards hanging from pegs will confront you. Arranged alphabetically, each announces, “I am” on its top half and includes a distinct phrase below — “a ray of sunshine,” “a hobo,” “a water protector,” “a pornographer,” “an arborist,” “a U.F.O. abductee.” Ticket holders are told to choose how they’d like to be seen. (I took “the walrus,” because it made me laugh and reminded me of my grandfather, who used to do a tableside comedy bit with chopsticks in place of tusks.)“In & Of Itself,” directed by Frank Oz, is ostensibly a show about identity. How we see ourselves. How others see us. How Mr. DelGaudio, a phenomenally talented magician last seen in the two-sorceror show “Nothing to Hide,” can set himself apart from the rest of the abracadabra crowd.It’s a tantalizing theme, especially in a political moment when how you voted or didn’t can seem like identifier enough. But this premise is mostly loose scaffolding on which to arrange a short evening of sly and artful deceptions and effects.Dressed in a three-piece suit, with a gaudy purple tie hovering below his stubbled cherub face, Mr. DelGaudio tells some stories and does some tricks. Backed by Mark Mothersbaugh’s electro-twang score, he divides a pack of cards; he disappears a brick; he presents an audience member with a note from a nearest and dearest. He recounts a tale he heard in a bar in Spain and offers a more personal story about discovering his young mother in a clinch with another woman, and crying that night because he knew he’d never have a dad.Throughout, he sprinkles fortune cookie bons mots of the kind he would have mocked in the rowdier “Nothing to Hide”: “Every secret has a weight.” “True identity is that which exists in your own heart and is seen by others.” “Knowing you won’t believe me is the only reason I’m going to tell you the truth.” Oh, please. Who comes to a magic show for truth? It’s enough to make you wistful for capes and linked rings and cockatoos.There are other hitches, too. For much of the evening, the buildup for each trick is too lengthy, the commitment to personal revelation too patchy. Mr. DelGaudio seems torn between wanting to deliver gee-whiz effects and wanting to withhold them in service of something more sophisticated. Often, he retreats into a kind of formality although his looser, cockier, dude persona is more winning. And the aggressively bland title is the kind you choose only if all other titles have been taken.But here’s the real wizardry: The show works. Beautifully. Tenderly. Astonishingly. Those “I am” cards return for the finale, and while it would be unsporting to say too much more about them, they allow Mr. DelGaudio a momentary connection to any audience member who proves willing. To watch this routine is to see 20 or 30 or 40 people each receive a private benediction and leave the theater, heads aswirl.If you have a restless mind or an allergy to amazement, you can make some decent guesses about how this trick is done, but where’s the fun in that? Wonder is a rare commodity these days. So take a card. Any card. And find it."
58b3531d7c459f2525d1e9f6,Review: Gisela João Gives Voice to Fado’s Spectrum of Passions,2017-02-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/arts/music/review-gisela-joao-gives-voice-to-fados-spectrum-of-passions.html,The New York Times,"“A lot of people think that fado is sad. Fado is not sad. Fado is intense. It’s like life.”So said Gisela João, Portugal’s most widely acclaimed fado singer to emerge in this decade, as she headlined the first NY Fado Festival. Her luminous concert at the Schimmel Center encompassed both desperate heartache and light-footed whimsy.Fado, which is Portuguese for “destiny” or “fate,” is a musical tradition that was recognized by Unesco in 2011 as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.” Fado emerged from the taverns of Lisbon, mingling the many influences of a port city, to become a matter of national pride, culminating in the 1950s and 1960s with worldwide recognition of the queen of fado, Amália Rodrigues.The songs, often about tragic love, balance a singer’s raw drama with the exquisite high counterpoint of the 12-stringed Portuguese guitarra, which can sound like a harpsichord or a bouzouki. After falling out of favor with a generation — in part because fado was associated with the era of fascist dictatorship that ended in 1974 — the 21st century has brought renewed appreciation and new performers to fado.Ms. João, whose debut album went to No. 1 in Portugal when it was released in 2013 and whose second album, “Nua,” came out last year, is a musical traditionalist. As on her albums, she was backed by a pristine trio of guitarra (Ricardo Parreira), classical guitar (Nelson Aleixo) and acoustic bass guitar (Francisco Gaspar); they opened the concert with an instrumental set that hinted at fado’s kinship with music around the Mediterranean.From her first song, “Madrugada sem Sono” (“Dawn Without Sleep”), Ms. João summoned a full spectrum of fado’s tempestuous passions, from hushed melancholy to eruptive, rough-edged, tearful peaks to aching resignation. Each of her ballads was its own drama, a white-knuckled journey through seismic emotions.Yet Ms. João was hardly the black-clad, austerely mournful fado singer of earlier eras. Her chair and microphone stand were garlanded with bright flowers, and she wore a white, shiny minidress with its own leafy texture. She sipped white wine and offered smiling commentary in English, and after a few songs, she slipped out of her high heels and cheerfully admitted, “I’m short.”She had humorous songs like “O Senhor Extraterrestre” (“Mr. Alien”), about a friendly conversation with a green man who arrives via U.F.O. and goes “beep.” Another song, “Noite de Sao João” (“St. John’s Night”), had lyrics by a Portuguese rapper, Capicua. With her shoes off, she danced to her up-tempo songs.Ms. João reaches beyond Portugal for songs that she transforms into fado; her set included a song from the Brazilian songwriter Cartola and the traditional Mexican song “La Llorona,” both of them suffused with fado’s introspection and fierce attentiveness to poetic nuance.She also treats fado’s heritage with both deep respect and modern perspective. Her first hit in Portugal was a single, “O Meu Amigo Está Longe” (“My Friend Is Far Away”), from the Rodrigues repertoire, and she sang it on Saturday as an outpouring of loneliness compounded by unending love. But her version also connected the song with the chord progression of Aerosmith’s “Dream On”: a little revisionism to help an intense tradition endure."
596124c67c459f246b618005,"Vlad, the Trump Impaler",2017-07-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/opinion/sunday/putin-trump-bannon-taxes.html,The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — Hark!What light from yonder West Wing window breaks. A bright idea has somehow emerged from the dysfunctional, dystopian Trump White House.And from the Grim Reaper, no less.Steve Bannon has not been partying in the Hamptons with Jared, Ivanka and Kellyanne. He has instead been lurking in his lair, scheming about a plan to raise taxes on the richest people in America and give tax cuts to the people who need them.As Jonathan Swan wrote when he broke the story in Axios, “It’s classic Bannon — pushing a maximalist position that’s reviled by the Republican establishment.”Conservative craniums are exploding all over town. Mitch McConnell had already been worried that Donald Trump might revert to the pragmatist who gave Chuck Schumer and Hillary donations and triangulate with Democrats.And Bannon’s fellow former Goldman Sachs money men, Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, are rushing to strip away the tax burdens on the rich and corporations because, in the immortal words of Mitt Romney, “Corporations are people, my friend.”As Grover Norquist, the anti-tax evangelist, howled, “It’s a particularly cruel thing for Bannon to do.”In his role as Keeper of the Essence, the one who tends the flame between Trump and his base, Bannon has been guilty of plenty of cruel things, from the botched travel ban to “American carnage” to the fixation with the wall to the offensive tripe in Breitbart when he ran it.As the rumpled hero to white nationalists likes to say, “Darkness is good.”But while this idea is going nowhere, it’s not cruel. Bannon is right to challenge his colleagues’ claim that the rich pour money from tax cuts back into the economy.If you give a tax cut to people who make a million a year or more, they save the money. But if you give a tax cut to working-class and poor people, they spend the money. So the multiplier effect for the economy is much higher with tax cuts for people who don’t have a lot of money.Bannon understands that if President Trump gave a raspberry to plutocrats, including all the ones in his own administration, he would grow more popular. (It would be hard to grow less popular.)For all Trump’s insanity, he is in a unique place to do some interesting things because he’s not beholden to the usual suspects. He’s barely even a Republican, so it would be a smart strategy to work with Democrats on the things he agrees with, that Democrats can’t say no to.Why doesn’t Trump indulge his predilection for acting against expectations in a way that could be a boon to his base, or “my people,” as he calls them? Why squander all that combativeness and impulsiveness on Twitter insults? Why settle into an angry standoff with a majority of the country? It’s an exhausting dynamic that breeds a siege mentality — a mind-set that was succinctly described by Kellyanne Conway at a recent Washington dinner as “they hate us and we hate them.”Why doesn’t Trump channel all that bile against the establishment and show us his purported negotiating skills by sitting down and working out an actual deal that could benefit a lot of the people in Trump country who need health care rather than backing the “mean” House and Senate plans that are going to hit rural America particularly hard?Instead, he is down the rabbit hole with Vladimir Putin. Much of his base does not appreciate it when the American president stands in the Oval Office yucking it up with Russian diplomats, oversharing our secrets and calling the F.B.I. director he just fired “a nut job.”Even a lot of Trump voters are mystified about why Trump can’t put a lid on his id long enough to acknowledge that Russia besmirched our elections.“It could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries, and I won’t be specific but I think a lot of people interfere,” President Trump said in Warsaw. “Nobody really knows.”He inanely tweeted from the G-20: “Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!”Even for a U.F.O. believer like Podesta, Trump’s claim was out of this world.In his attenuated first meeting with his side bae, Trump staged a Kabuki show of confronting the former K.G.B. agent.Their conversation boiled down to this:Trump: “Did you do it?”Putin: “Nyet.”Trump: “Whew! Glad that’s out of the way. So let’s do a joint cybersecurity program and share our passwords.”Putin: “Da.”He should have had a showdown to rival the one Adlai Stevenson had at the U.N. with the Soviet ambassador on the Cuban missile crisis. “I am prepared to wait for an answer until hell freezes over,” Stevenson snapped.Trump should have slapped down the evidence and doled out the punishment. Instead, he and Putin commiserated about bumptious journalists.“Polonium works well,” Putin was probably saying.“Spasibo,” Trump probably replied.In the end, Trump and fellow bumbling neophyte Rex Tillerson opened the portal wider for Putin to sneak through in coming elections.I don’t know how much information the tyro pol in the Oval has absorbed — or even wants to absorb — in his dumbed-down briefings. But, brainwashed by his father’s exhortation that the world belongs to “killers,” Trump clearly doesn’t recognize the danger before him.This is a simple fact he might want to let sink in: The Russians do not have our best interests at heart. They are conjuring Trump’s worst “1984” fear: playing him for a sucker."
5b559920068401528a2d0533,Finding Yourself in Los Angeles,2018-07-23,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/travel/los-angeles-retreats-spiritual.html,The New York Times,"This article has drawn significant feedback. It has since been edited. Read our response here. It was 3:30 p.m. I was already running half an hour late. This was because I am not from Los Angeles and I had grossly underestimated the time it would take to get from Santa Monica to West Adams on Interstate 10, a mere 11 miles as the crow flies.That sound you hear right now is the sound of a thousand Angelenos scoffing: “The 10? Going east? At that hour? What are you some kind of masochist?”What should’ve taken me 12 minutes took over an hour in five-lane, bumper-to-bumper traffic. There’s a kind of existential calm that settles over you when surrounded by such a sea of cars, when there is no chance of anyone getting anywhere anytime soon. Even the on-ramps seem to be in on the joke: like a bouncer at a very desirable club, a traffic light allows only a single car at a time the great privilege of merging into this gridlock. Sitting there you must embrace the ancient, contradictory notion of festina lente: to make haste slowly. You are not where you are supposed to be, but you are where you are.This meditative mind-set was fitting for my 3 p.m. appointment, which I was now 45 minutes late to. I was supposed to be visiting the Peace Awareness Labyrinth & Gardens as part of a larger quest to seek out spaces of refuge and retreat across the city’s endless suburban sprawl. I wanted to find the quiet, contemplative Los Angeles, the hidden pockets of reverence, reflection, silence; places Angelenos repair to in order to recharge their batteries so that they are ready to face another day, another traffic jam, another screaming child, another vindictive boss. A city is not necessarily defined by its landmarks or its flashiest moments but by all the subtle ways its citizens forge the necessary solitude that allows them to live in proximity to their neighbors.The Peace Awareness Labyrinth & Gardens is tucked behind a Beaux-Arts Italian villa on one of those wide, anonymous Los Angeles boulevards. These boulevards offer both the best and worst of the city: there are never any pedestrians; every surface is too bright; every lawn too green, and yet every building, no matter how garish, has some fantastical story to tell if only you stop to listen.The Italian Renaissance Revival villa that houses the Peace Gardens is sandwiched between a Polish shrine to Pope St. John Paul II and a low-slung stucco apartment block that looks like the scene of a murder in a 1930s noir film. The lavish villa was built in 1914 for Secondo Guasti, a penniless Italian immigrant who became California’s largest winemaker despite widespread skepticism at the time that such an industry could ever thrive in the state. In 1974 the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, a new-age church focused on “soul transcendence,” purchased the villa and in 2002 constructed the Peace Awareness Labyrinth & Gardens, optimistically, for a post-9/11 world. The gardens are open to the public by appointment. If possible, try not to miss your appointment because of existential traffic jams.Despite the late hour, I was greeted at the villa’s entrance by a kind man named Juan Roberto.“We’re very glad you’re here,” he said. Memories of Interstate 10 bedlam began to evaporate as we promenaded through the compact, tiered garden, serenaded by the gentle babble of small fountains. The Japanese call such walks shinrin-yoku, or “forest bathing.”“There used to be many more plants, too many plants,” said Juan Roberto. “We realized you needed open space to reflect.”He showed me how to walk the labyrinth, a circular pathway of travertine marble. Have you ever walked a labyrinth? Labyrinths, unlike mazes, are unicursal — they have only one way in and one way out. Each step becomes a purposeful movement. They are an ancient form of meditation; this one is based on the labyrinth at the Chartres Cathedral in France, built in the early 13th century. As you walk, the city becomes a distant dream, a movie half-remembered. In a way, it is bit like the festina lente of Interstate 10, but without the cars, the smog, the man in the neon-yellow Dodge Charger listening to Whitesnake’s “Here I go Again” at peak volume. One way in, one way out.What is strange is that many Angelenos I talked to echoed this view of interstate gridlock as a kind of contemplative lacuna. I was told on multiple occasions that in order to be truly at home in this city, you had to make peace with your commute.“My car is my safe space,” one person told me.“It’s all about the podcast,” said another.For many, the car, that private palace of glass and steel, is now the place where we perform the majority of our essential business; the place where we make up, break up, wake up.Maybe it is the East Coaster in me, but I find this slightly dispiriting. Have our automobiles replaced our churches? Can you practice shinrin-yoku in a Chevy? Cars and all their associated infrastructure do not help build communities in cities. For decades, interstates have cleaved open neighborhoods, lowered property values and compounded segregation. What will happen when fully autonomous vehicles arrive on a wide scale and we can finally take our hands off the wheel? Will we binge-watch Netflix shows during our commute? Will we ever get out of our cars again?Then again, places of refuge can take on all forms. Who am I to judge? A sanctuary for one can be a hell for another. In New York City, where space is at a premium, there are strict, unspoken codes of privacy and proximity: you can stand this close in a subway car and this close in an elevator and this close while waiting in line for an egg and cheese. An end seat on the subway becomes a private temple. A pair of earphones offers a vital cocoon of sound. A corner of a closet becomes a consecrated shrine to high-top shoes.In Los Angeles, there is more room to spread out. Aside from the strange liminal anomaly of downtown, Los Angeles is not a vertical city; it is a city of boulevards and interchanges, of 30-foot palm trees and drive-through liquor stores. The quality of life is better. You can have fresh avocados every morning; the weather is like free Xanax; you can take meetings in the morning and be chased by a bobcat in the afternoon. Given such a bounty of natural riches, do Angelenos even need spaces of retreat? Or was the entire city its own surreal sanctuary?Our family stayed at an Airbnb in Echo Park in a little 1920s bungalow nestled behind our hosts’ home. Echo Park is a fairly unique locale in Los Angeles in that you can walk most places. I even saw other people walking on the sidewalk. We made the secret walker sign to one another. As I walked, I noticed the self-contained worlds of people’s forecourts: a petite bench beneath a prolific grapefruit tree, a strange flock of robot sculptures, what looked like the world’s tiniest vineyard. I walked up the hill to Elysian Park and discovered secret, unnamed streets not on any map. Our Airbnb hosts had placed a couple of chairs and a table in the middle of a little dead end to nowhere.Where is your retreat? What do you do to escape from it all?My friend Rains took me to the many stunning gardens of The Huntington in San Marino, where we wandered for hours getting our shinrin-yoku on. Through the Children’s Garden, the alien-like Desert Garden, the Garden of Flowing Fragrance, the Japanese Garden. Each a complete universe unto itself. The Japanese Garden features the Zen Court and breathtaking bonsai collection. The miniature trees were like perfect haikus: the bald cypress, the Catlin elm, the Foemina juniper. I left transformed, though I’m not sure if afterward the world seemed smaller or I just seemed bigger.My friend Dehn recommended that I go downtown to visit the Last Bookstore. Downtown Los Angeles, or “DTLA,” as it is now referred to in real estate literature, is an uncanny place. Walking around, I was constantly plagued by a feeling of déjà vu, perhaps because, as Thom Anderson points out in his documentary “Los Angeles Plays Itself,” this downtown has stood in for so many other downtowns on the silver screen that it has become a kind of everyplace.To get downtown, I did what one normally does in a city: I took the subway. It was, at least when I rode it, practically empty. There was a slight sense of metaphysical unease in the train car, as if everyone was looking around and wondering: Why aren’t you in a car? And what about you?I emerged from the cavernous, Art Deco masterpiece of Union Station into a neighborhood where each shop seemed to be peddling only one thing: the shop selling Jesus statuettes was next to the shop selling giant stuffed bears was next to the shop selling soccer uniforms for babies was next to the shop selling piñatas.In recent years there has been a big effort to rejuvenate Downtown Los Angeles. Amid this urban rejuvenation you will find the Last Bookstore, one of the world’s best. In the past, Los Angeles had developed an unfair reputation for being anti-intellectual. In reality, the city is a vibrant, artistic, literary place; perhaps it is the sprawl that makes its various beacons of culture feel like stars in a distant constellation. The list of writers who have attempted to capture the city’s many beguiling contradictions is long and varied: Raymond Chandler, Joan Didion, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathanael West, Charles Bukowski, Eve Babitz.Their ghosts haunt the Last Bookstore. When you enter, you are asked to hand over your backpack. This is ostensibly to prevent shoplifting but it felt more symbolic, as though you must leave any remnant of the outside world behind. As soon as you pass through the front door, it is as if you have entered a different era, before the death of our collective attention. The Last Bookstore is truly a refuge, books literally form walls and windows, archways, tumble off shelves. The place feels like a living, breathing being, with various catacombs and vaults and catwalks that disobey the laws of gravity. I spent all afternoon there, stumbling upon books that I never knew I was missing.Even if Los Angeles crumbled around it—burned up in the wildfires, collapsed in an earthquake, dried up in a drought, was entombed in a mudslide— the Last Bookstore would still remain. When my backpack was finally returned to me upon my exit, it took a moment to adjust to the idea that I would need such a bag again, that there was still a place outside where backpacks were useful.Not all places of retreat need be solitary or introspective. Some people recharge their life force surrounded by the cultural vibrancy of others. While not exactly a spiritual sanctuary, perhaps there is no better symbol of the new DTLA than the resurgent Grand Central Market, which is the most exciting food court I have ever been to, buzzing with the electricity of a thousand cuisines. A plethora of scrumptious concoctions meant to be held and devoured in the hands: sake-poached octopus tostadas, a half-dozen sweet oysters from Puget Sound, crying tiger steak with chili sauce and sticky rice, a fancy-pants PB & J called the “red eye” made from espresso peanut butter and dark chocolate raspberry jam. Is there a horror film where a man eats and eats in a food court without rest until he eventually explodes?Across town, far from the urban stage set of downtown, you will find two beautiful, divergent sites of reflection and retreat in the Pacific Palisades.The Self-Realization Lake Shrine, perched in a little hollow at the terminus of Sunset Boulevard just above the Pacific Ocean, is the bizarre, transportive sanctuary dreamed up by Paramahansa Yogananda and opened in 1950. Like many places in Los Angeles, the origin story of the Lake Shrine is the stuff of Hollywood movies. The man-made lake was owned for a time in the 1940s by the superintendent of construction for 20th Century Fox, who turned it into a strange film set, importing a two-story Mississippi houseboat and building a replica of a Dutch windmill. Because obviously this is what one does when one owns a lake in Los Angeles.The property was in turn sold to an oil executive who planned on turning the lake into a resort. Except then he began having this recurring dream in which he had transformed the site into a Church of All Religions. The oil executive looked up “Church of All Religions” in the phone book (this was back when people looked in phone books) and found Yogananda, who somehow already knew he would be calling. Yogananda accepted the property and constructed a temple, a meditation garden and a peace memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.I visited the Lake Shrine on a cold, misty day, more reminiscent of San Francisco than Los Angeles. The houseboat is still there. The windmill has been transformed into a meditation chapel. Somehow they fit perfectly within this hodgepodge of serene spirituality. It is a collage of eclectic yet entangled visions and in this way it feels very “L.A.”I wandered the path of the lake, stumbling upon people in various states of contemplation. Two enlightened swans floated by. I wondered if they were paid actors.Just down Sunset Boulevard is an entirely different kind of refuge, the home of the legendary modernist designers Charles and Ray Eames. This is the couple who reimagined space and time for us in their brilliant short film “Powers of Ten,” the couple who revolutionized the way we sit, play, look. Constructed in 1949 out of huge sheets of glass and prefabricated sections of steel, their house, like their work, is at once intensely utilitarian and intensely daring. Joyous, even. The Eameses lived there for the duration of their lives.The house is actually two rectangular cubes of glass, quietly set into the hillside. The open, modular floor plans are filled with the delectable detritus of a lifetime of thinking and designing: African masks, bright Afghan textiles, little prototypes for toys never built. It is the urtext, what every midcentury modern space before and since aspires to be.Crucially, the attention of the house is not focused on itself but on its serene surrounds, a little wild meadow surrounded by a grove of eucalyptus trees, the ocean just visible beyond.This was their retreat, their “shock absorber,” as they termed it, from the outside world. But it was also a place of work. One of the cubes functioned as their studio, a space of collaboration and experimentation where their colleagues would come and get messy. And it is this duality that I am most drawn to: that a private space of contemplation can also be a place of intense activation. A retreat is not so much a retreat but a re-turn, a re-think, a re-view, in its literal sense. All my best ideas come when I have stepped away from my office, when I am in the shower or running or shinrin-yoku-ing and have a chance to view my work from a new angle. I have learned to keep little notebooks in strange places. Every car in Los Angeles should come equipped with a Dictaphone in the glovebox.The most profound retreat from the city remains actually retreating from the city. So when the weekend rolled round we made like the locals and fled the City of Angels for the temptations of the high desert. You have to drive a couple of hours to escape the metro area’s prolific spread, which percolates into the surrounding valleys like an ever-growing amoeba, but when you finally do, the Mojave Desert swallows you whole.The desert landscape plays strange tricks on your mind; like a Rorschach test, its deceptive minimalism brings whatever ails you into focus. A group of 19th-century Mormon settlers, upon first spotting a Yucca brevifolia, termed it a “Joshua tree” because they believed it resembled the biblical Joshua, hands raised in prayer. Years later, a small band from Ireland would name an album after the same plant because they believed it represented the broken, beautiful 1980s America about which they sang.If the high desert is a hot spot for seekers of transcendence, then the hot spot within the hot spot is the Integratron, a 38-foot-tall wooden cupola in the tiny village of Landers, built in the 1970s by aircraft mechanic and U.F.O. conspiracy theorist George Van Tassel at the confluence of several powerful geomagnetic fault lines. The dome is constructed completely out of Douglas fir, without the use of a single nail. During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, when much of Landers collapsed, the Integratron didn’t budge an inch. Or so the story goes. In the desert, there is a casual distance between story and truth.Van Tassel, who claimed he had once been abducted by Venusians, built the Integratron as a kind of time machine. He had plans to construct a multiple wave oscillator that would utilize a high voltage Tesla coil to rejuvenate biological tissue. Twenty-minute intervals inside the dome would allegedly add years to one’s life. Unfortunately, Van Tassel was never able to test his machine as he died of a heart attack just before its opening in 1978. The machine’s plans then mysteriously disappeared.Today the Integratron is owned by three sisters originally from Long Island. For the last 15 years they have been performing sound baths in the “acoustically perfect” dome using a series of quartz singing bowls that are precisely tuned to the body’s seven chakras. Apparently Angelenos’ chakras are way out of whack; these sound baths are booked months in advance.As you prepare for your sound bath, there is a little courtyard of hammocks and junkyard art where you can lounge, dream, pant. A statue of the Virgin Mary sits among a cactus grove.When it was finally my turn, I entered the Integratron alongside my fellow sound bathers — hipsters, Mormons, surfers, aliens, a pro basketball player — and lay down on my mat, ears turned heavenward.The sound hit me like a tsunami. For a moment I couldn’t breath. I wondered if I would have to leave. You don’t often encounter sound that pure, that encompassing. It was loud, but not necessarily in the volume-sense we normally consider. It was not turned up to 11. Rather, it was voluminous — all around, inhabiting every pore, burrowing its ways into my bones.Gradually I relaxed, accepting this sonic intrusion. Then, welcoming it. The bath lasts about 25 minutes; only a dozen or so extended notes are played on the bowls during this time. After it was all done, when I finally managed to extricate myself from the dome’s embrace, I had trouble walking a straight line. My chakras had not been bathed, they had been power washed.As I was leaving, I overheard a couple arguing whether they could make it back to the city in time to catch their favorite yoga class. The traffic would be “fierce,” said the man. I wanted to tell him about the labyrinth, about festina lente, about the Dictaphone in his glovebox. I couldn’t find the words.“How do you feel?” a woman in a cowboy hat asked me, spotting my chakral wobble.“I feel like I’m in a movie,” I said.“Amen,” she said.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the gardens of the Huntington. The Huntington is in San Marino, not Pasadena. Two picture captions repeated the error.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an American writer. He is Nathanael West, not Nathaniel.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Los Angeles subway is not underground. Los Angeles Metro Rail includes underground lines."

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Here’s what you need to know:• World leaders gather in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly. We’ll be watching their posturing on climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, atrocities in Myanmar and North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.Many of the leaders will be scrutinizing President Trump, who is set to deliver his first centerpiece speech there tomorrow.For Nikki Haley, the American envoy, the week will be a test of how much influence she has among her peers and on Mr. Trump. Here’s a brief explainer of the gathering’s significance and the U.N.’s broader challenges._____• Britain lowered its terrorism threat level, a day after the police arrested a second man late Saturday in connection with a bombing in a London subway station that left 29 people injured.The Islamic State claimed responsibility for Friday’s crude bombing attack, which was the fifth terrorist attack in the country this year.“It’s really important that we show business as usual rather than allow terrorists to disrupt our way of life and stop us doing what we’re doing,” said Sadiq Khan, the mayor, as London Fashion Week began on the day of the bombing with a defiant shrug.Above, armed police officers outside a Scottish Premiership soccer match in Glasgow on Saturday._____• Arrivals of migrants in Italy have plunged in recent months, leading some to charge that the government in Rome was paying off Libya’s warlords, condemning migrants to misery in militant-run detention centers there.Italian officials denied such payments and said that they had instead resorted to diplomacy. “We approached the issue slowly, slowly, Italian style,” a deputy foreign minister said. “We spoke to everyone.”Separately, Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, announced his intention to lead his center-right party’s ballot again in the next elections._____• A clash is brewing between America’s tech giants and an increasing number of governments worried about the companies’ influence and reach. Many regulators are mimicking Europe’s stance on digital privacy, using tougher rules to control how parts of the internet are run.Our correspondents looked at how Facebook, which is used by more than two billion people each month, tries to win over wary regulators. “Ultimately, it’s a grand power struggle,” said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet.Our media columnist argues that Facebook should reveal more about what it knows about Russian interference in last year’s U.S. presidential election.Today, the European Commission is expected to publish a list of options for taxing technology companies._____• Across the world, more people are now obese than underweight.Western food companies like Nestlé are aggressively expanding in developing nations, contributing to a new epidemic of diabetes and heart disease, chronic illnesses that are fed by soaring rates of obesity in places that struggled with hunger and malnutrition just a generation ago.• New technologies are testing the limits of computer semiconductors. To deal with that, researchers are taking design cues from human brains.• Rolling Stone, the magazine that was once a bible for the counterculture, is going up for sale on the eve of its 50th anniversary.• Dogecoin was meant to poke fun at the hype around virtual currencies. But investors didn’t get the joke and bought it anyway, bringing its market value as high as $400 million.• Recent U.S. statistics have been rosy. But look farther back, and you’ll find a 50-year decline in men’s lifetime earnings.• Here’s a snapshot of global markets.• In Myanmar, a new generation of Rohingya Muslims is being radicalized by persecution and an apartheidlike existence in the Buddhist-majority country.

His viewers don’t know his day job: He owns a New York City bodega.• Two rare white giraffes were spotted in Kenya and captured on video, in what is believed to be the first such footage.On this day in 1973, Jimmy Carter, then governor of Georgia, filled out a report saying that he had seen a U.F.O.It wasn’t such a strange statement at the time — a Gallup poll that year found that 51 percent of people interviewed believed in unidentified flying objects, and that 11 percent believed they had seen “a flying saucer” themselves.Mr. Carter filed his report with the unofficial National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and said he had seen the object in Leary, Ga., in 1969.Decades later, he recounted the incident on CNN: “I and about 25 others saw something in the air that changed colors and was round and came and left. We couldn’t figure out what it was.”But he added that he believed it was impossible “to have space people from other planets or other stars” come to Earth.While he didn’t believe they could visit us, Mr. Carter did record a message for “possible unknown civilizations in the galaxies” as president. It was part of the golden record placed in the Voyager in August 1977.He said it represented “our hope and our determination, our good will in the vast and awesome universe.”Karen Zraick contributed reporting._____Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.This briefing was prepared for the European morning.

Here’s what you need to know:• North Korea’s nuclear program and repeated missile tests will be a major focal point as world leaders gather in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly.President Trump, who appeared to refer to the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man” in a tweet, delivers his centerpiece speech to the assembly on Tuesday. He has lunch on Thursday with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who, in an Op-Ed, argues for stronger enforcement of the sanctions against the North.Our reporters note U.S. intelligence is trying to determine if ingredients for the unusually powerful fuel the North used in its latest launch may be flowing into the country from China and Russia.Many of the leaders will be scrutinizing Mr. Trump, who is attending for the first time, to see how his America First approach fits into the U.N.’s world-first mission.

595ead627c459f246b617af1,Whiteboard? Check. Lab Rats? They’re the Actors.,2017-07-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/theater/whiteboard-check-lab-rats-theyre-the-actors.html,The New York Times,"Devised-theater companies like Improbable fumble their way to a completed piece through trial and error. They come up with a theory for what might work, then test that theory until they realize that it doesn’t. Preordained destinations rarely pan out.Or, as the Improbable co-artistic director Lee Simpson put it, “You head off and then you turn around and see where you’ve gone.”Not so different from scientists, really, which made Lauren Slater’s controversial 2004 book, “Opening Skinner’s Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the 20th Century,” such an enticing — if counterintuitive — title for adaptation.Improbable’s past offerings have riffed off works ranging from Shakespeare (“The Tempest”) to campy Vincent Price horror films (“Theater of Blood”), typically taking considerable liberties and adding bold visuals along the way. But “Opening Skinner’s Box,” which begins on Monday at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater as part of the Lincoln Center Festival, plays it surprisingly straight. “This piece is sort of ridiculously faithful to the book, which is not like us,” Mr. Simpson said.Still, fidelity to the printed page, in this case, requires any number of modifications, visual and auditory. Here are some of them.The Improbable creative team — perhaps best known for its work on the Philip Glass operas “Satyagraha” and “Akhnaten” — built the piece’s central visual element, a box-shaped playing area, out of taut bungee cords. These cords allow the actors to expand or constrict the shape of the box as needed.“For me, the box is about the scientific method,” Mr. Simpson said. “You need to create something of a closed system so that it’s repeatable. But that’s kind of a useful pretense because nothing is a closed system.”“We have to remember that it’s not true,” he continued, although “it’s O.K. to pretend that it’s true because you can learn a lot of useful stuff that way.”Several of the experiments used animal subjects: lab rats, of course, but also rhesus monkeys and sea slugs. Improbable’s six actors play each of these creatures at one point or another.“We entertained the idea of using toy monkeys because we do anthropomorphize them,” Mr. Simpson said. “But we never found the right toy monkeys.” And so it’s the actors who skitter about and push imaginary levers for imaginary food.A segment on cognitive dissonance, which hinges on a much-anticipated U.F.O. that never arrived, was a boon for the sound designer, Adrienne Quartly, resulting in some of her most (literally) out-there work.Ms. Quartly augmented what she called the “highly satirical, outer-worldly” music with manipulated recordings of a cast member performing some nasal singing.Her other showcase comes in the segment devoted to Stanley Milgram and his infamous obedience experiment, in which subjects proved all too willing to deliver what they believed to be crippling electrical shocks to a fellow subject (actually an undercover experimenter).The interactive nature of this experiment inspired Ms. Quartly to put a scientific-looking sound effects controller onstage, “allowing the actors to put a ‘real’ element into the Milgram story.”Throughout her book, Lauren Slater herself is a prominent character: drawing comparisons between past experiments and her own life, recounting conversations with experimenters, even conducting her own version of at least one experiment.The author was not involved in the production (“We had the Devil’s own job even finding her to get the rights,” Mr. Simpson said), but she is just as present within the play, where she is played by Kate Maravan.“First we had to disassemble the book and go back one step further,” Mr. Simpson said, “and then adapt that for the stage.”Not all of the scientists described and even depicted were happy with Ms. Slater’s work. Dr. Robert Spitzer, who played an instrumental role in developing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, even conducted his own study to question Ms. Slater’s re-creation of a 1973 experiment.Rather than evade or elide these criticisms, Improbable incorporated them into the story. “We felt we couldn’t tell the story of the book without, to some degree, telling the stories of these controversies,” Mr. Simpson said.Sometimes the scientists set the record straight, as in a fictionalized dialogue between Ms. Slater and Elizabeth Loftus, who contended then and now that the book misrepresented her own work and her statements about the malleability of memory.“It just bothers me as a scientist,” Ms. Loftus said by phone recently. “I believe that a more educated population is good for society, and it offends me that someone with such reach would make so many mistakes.” (Efforts to reach Ms. Slater for comment were unsuccessful.)A common pitfall for anyone trying to impart scientific information to a lay audience is how to keep the material from becoming too dry. In other words, how not to merely stand in front of a whiteboard and deliver a lecture. So one of the most visually effective sequences in “Opening Skinner’s Box,” dedicated to John M. Darley and Bibb Latané’s studies on bystander intervention, makes its case with … a giant whiteboard.As they discuss the 1964 killing of Kitty Genovese and the 38 witnesses who supposedly did nothing — a number that came from a New York Times article that has since been called into question — two actors in white coats fill a whiteboard that spans the entire stage with statistics, charts, cartoon faces and even wisps of smoke (from a related experiment).“We wanted to use it more, but the place where we had the set built didn’t do it very well,” Mr. Simpson said. “It took so long to get the bloody thing lowered and raised up again that we only did it once.”"
59ae67b67c459f246b621c24,Fake News: It’s as American as George Washington’s Cherry Tree,2017-09-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/books/review/kurt-andersen-fantasyland-how-america-went-haywire.html,The New York Times,"FANTASYLAND How America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History By Kurt Andersen 462 pp. Random House. $30.Reading a great revisionist history of America is the bookish way to feel what it’s like to be born again. Suddenly past, present and future are connected by a visible thread. Stray details and aberrations start to make sense. You feel ashamed, but also enlightened, because at least you have named the sin: You belong to a nation of bloodthirsty colonizers (Howard Zinn), or anti-intellectuals (Richard Hofstadter) or, in Kurt Andersen’s latest opus, a people who have committed themselves over the last half century to florid, collective delusion.If, for example, you remain confused about what happened in the last election, Andersen’s retelling of history will clarify things for you. As a host of public radio’s Studio 360, a best-selling novelist and a cultural omnivore, Andersen has been tracking and storing the data on the nation’s unraveling for decades. And he knew that what happened that November night, and in the subsequent months, was not just inevitable but in many ways our nation’s natural destiny. As he explains in what must have been an alarmingly self-confirming last chapter: Donald Trump is “stupendous Exhibit A” in the landscape of “Fantasyland,” a fitting leader for a nation that has, over the centuries, nurtured a “promiscuous devotion to the untrue.”Fake news. Post-truth. Alternative facts. For Andersen, these are not momentary perversions but habits baked into our DNA, the ultimate expressions of attitudes “that have made America exceptional for its entire history.” The country’s initial devotion to religious and intellectual freedom, Andersen argues, has over the centuries morphed into a fierce entitlement to custom-made reality. So your right to believe in angels and your neighbor’s right to believe in U.F.O.s and Rachel Dolezal’s right to believe she is black lead naturally to our president’s right to insist that his crowds were bigger.Andersen’s history begins at the beginning, with the first comforting lie we tell ourselves. Each year we teach our children about Pilgrims, those gentle robed creatures who landed at Plymouth Rock. But our real progenitors were the Puritans, who passed the weeks on the trans-Atlantic voyage preaching about the end times and who, when they arrived, vowed to hang any Quaker or Catholic who landed on their shores. They were zealots and also well-educated British gentlemen, which set the tone for what Andersen identifies as a distinctly American endeavor: propping up magical thinking with elaborate scientific proof.While Newton and Locke were ushering in an Age of Reason in Europe, over in America unreason was taking new seductive forms. A series of mystic visionaries were planting the seeds of extreme entitlement, teaching Americans that they didn’t have to study any book or old English theologian to know what to think, that whatever they felt to be true was true. In Andersen’s telling, you can easily trace the line from the self-appointed 17th-century prophet Anne Hutchinson to Kanye West: She was, he writes, uniquely American “because she was so confident in herself, in her intuitions and idiosyncratic, subjective understanding of reality,” a total stranger to self-doubt.What happens next in American history, according to Andersen, happens without malevolence, or even intention. Our national character gels into one that’s distinctly comfortable fogging up the boundary between fantasy and reality in nearly every realm. As soon as George Washington dies fake news is born — the story about the cherry tree, or his kneeling in prayer at Valley Forge. Enterprising businessmen quickly figure out ways to make money off the Americans who gleefully embrace untruths. The 1800s see an explosion of water cures and homeopathy and something called mesmerism, which concerns “electricity of the system thrown out of balance” (run that one by your yoga teachers). “Dr.” William A. Rockefeller, father of John D., gets his start mass-marketing a pink elixir called Microbe Killer.The quintessential American of the era is William Cody. He toured the country playing the character Buffalo Bill, fake-scalping actors playing Cheyenne warrior chiefs, and then actually scalping and killing real Cheyenne warrior chiefs while in costume as Buffalo Bill. Cody was in this way the father of Hollywood, the industry that did the most, Andersen says, to break down the mental barriers between the real and unreal.In the 1960s fantasyland goes into overdrive. Psychedelics, academic scholarship and the New Age movement conspire to make reason and reality the realms of idiots and squares. After the Kennedy assassinations, conspiracy theories become not just a fringe hobby but a “permanent feature of the American mental landscape.” U.F.O. sightings explode, and the stories become ever more elaborate, involving abductions and cover-ups and frolics and secret alliances with interplanetary beings.In the meantime, a kind of comfort with small fibs settles into the populace. When Andersen was young, he recalls, it was rare to see a woman over 50 whose hair was not gray or white. And apparently there were only eight plastic surgeons in all of Manhattan. But the market for hair color and plastic surgery explodes, as America starts writing its “national fiction of permanent youthfulness.”While the most persistent thread in “Fantasyland” is Christianity — the astounding number of Americans who believe in heaven and angels, which most of Europe gave up decades ago — Andersen reserves a starring role for the secular spiritualists. They were supposed to be a counterpoint to narrow-minded evangelicals, but Andersen says the New Agers committed an even greater sin than the faithful. What Anne Hutchinson started, Gestalt therapy finished off in the ’60s. Fritz Perls, a psychotherapist and Gestalt founder, simply put it: “I do my thing and you do your thing. I am not in this world to live up to your expectations, and you are not in this world to live up to mine.” Or put more simply: You do you.It’s clear that Andersen is uncomfortable with the extreme relativism we’ve settled into. But he doesn’t grapple with what it might mean to give that up. If there’s a flaw in this book, it’s repetitiveness. Andersen seems by nature a collector. He goes for wide rather than deep. So he doesn’t examine, for example, how we would separate the junk from the gems. After all, the explosion of subjective storytelling is what has brought us new and beautiful voices in literature, on television and on twitter.At the end of his book he tries to redraw a boundary that moves us a little closer to sanity. “You’re entitled to your own opinions and your own fantasies, but not your own facts — especially if your fantastical facts hurt people,” he says, echoing a comment by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. But the attempt is brief and feels halfhearted. By that point the pile up of detail — gun nuts, survivalists, web holes, scenes of cosplay, sci-fi shows and manufactured bubbles of hope — leaves a reader worried that a short manifesto on facts won’t save us.What we Americans need, it would seem, is something more powerful. A story to end all stories, preached by someone with the fire of Anne Hutchinson. A collective delusion so seductive that it will have us all, in Locke-step, bowing down to reason and reality. Anyone have any ideas?"

5b110b1a068401528a2b0e9c,He Fixes the Worst P.R. Crises Imaginable. Then Came Harvey Weinstein.,2018-06-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/style/michael-sitrick-harvey-weinstein-crisis-management.html,The New York Times,"Michael Sitrick couldn’t comment on Harvey Weinstein.Until a few weeks earlier, Mr. Sitrick’s crisis management firm, Sitrick and Company, had been managing Mr. Weinstein’s unprecedented crisis.Mr. Sitrick had dropped Mr. Weinstein, but he couldn’t say why. He couldn’t confirm if it was because Mr. Weinstein had stopped paying his bills, though he could confirm it was true that Mr. Weinstein had stopped paying his bills, and that the two parties were in arbitration.He couldn’t say if there were other factors. But he could say what were not factors. He could confirm, for instance, that he did not resign out of concern for his company’s own reputation. “You can’t do that,” Mr. Sitrick said. “You cannot put your firm’s interests ahead of the client’s interests.”Mr. Sitrick could also confirm that he had not grown morally uncomfortable with the flood of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. When I asked about this — and this was not long before Mr. Weinstein would be arrested in Manhattan on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act and swiftly indicted by a grand jury — he looked at me as if I’d just stepped off a U.F.O. “The law of this land is innocent until proven guilty,” Mr. Sitrick said. “There hasn’t been a single case that has gone to trial.”All this to say: Mr. Sitrick could not “comment,” but he could do what he has made a fortune doing for the better part of three decades. He could spin.Even if you don’t know his name, you know his work. Mr. Sitrick has been managing the narratives of besieged celebrities since the early 1990s.He represented Kelsey Grammer when the star was accused of having sex with his underage babysitter. He helped Christian Slater when the actor was arrested on charges of assaulting his girlfriend, biting a man who tried to stop him and then trying to grab a police officer’s gun. When Erin Everly, about whom Axl Rose wrote “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” was suing Mr. Rose for assault and sexual battery, Mr. Sitrick got her story on the cover of People magazine.Mr. Sitrick was retained by Halle Berry when she was in a hit-and-run, Naomi Campbell when she was accused of assaulting her housekeeper, and Rush Limbaugh when he was arrested on prescription drug charges.“Paris absolutely did not smoke pot Tuesday night or Wednesday morning,” Mr. Sitrick told a reporter shortly after Paris Hilton was released from jail in 2007. When The New York Daily News reported that Kobe Bryant may have been flirting with someone other than his wife at a Jay-Z concert, Mr. Sitrick was there to push back: “There was no touching of the face, and he did not dance with her.”It was Mr. Sitrick who released the first statement on behalf of Chris Brown after he was arrested on charges of assaulting Rihanna: “Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired. I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God’s help, to emerging a better person.”Mr. Sitrick has also deployed his strategies on behalf of Michael Vick (the dogfighting ring), Alex Rodriguez (the steroid scandal) and R. Kelly (where to begin).But although his celebrity clients attract a disproportionate amount of media coverage, they represent less than 10 percent of Mr. Sitrick’s caseload, he said. Corporate crises are his specialty, including Exxon after the Valdez oil spill, Enron during its accounting-fraud implosion and Theranos, the company that claimed to have revolutionized blood testing but didn’t. Mr. Sitrick helped Roy Disney oust Michael Eisner, and he helped American Apparel oust Dov Charney. He has represented the Daniel Pearl Foundation, on a pro bono basis, and the creator of “Girls Gone Wild.”One of Mr. Sitrick’s more notorious cases was for years taught at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, a kind of cautionary tale about the perils of going undercover.In the early 1990s, two producers for “Primetime Live,” an ABC news program, got jobs in Food Lion supermarkets and secretly videotaped workers, raising questions about the company’s meat handling practices. Food Lion then went to Mr. Sitrick, who obtained outtakes of the videos and raised questions about ABC’s practices, effectively turning a story about bad meat into a story about bad journalism.Richard Wald, an emeritus professor at Columbia, was an executive at ABC at the time, and he has asked Mr. Sitrick to address his journalism students over the years. The point of the lesson, according to Mr. Wald, is that “just because a journalist is finished with a story does not mean the story is finished with the journalist.” Of Mr. Sitrick’s work for Food Lion, Mr. Wald said: “He did an absolutely brilliant job, but it annoyed the hell out of me at the time.”Mr. Sitrick, 70, was once a journalism student himself, at the University of Maryland. He moved into public relations after graduation, following a stint reporting for the Baltimore News-American. “I love journalism,” he remembers telling his wife, Nancy Sitrick, “but I’d rather eat.”When Mr. Sitrick moved to Los Angeles with his wife and three young daughters and founded his firm, in 1989, he made it something of a policy to hire onetime editors and reporters. “It’s easier to teach journalists P.R. than to teach publicists what news judgment is,” he said.Sitrick and Company quickly acquired a reputation for pushing back against the press, using many of the same strategies as journalists. Mr. Sitrick represented the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles during its sex abuse scandal, the Kabbalah Center when journalists suspected it of being a cult, and the Church of Scientology during its investigation by The New Yorker.The prominent lawyer Edwin Stier, a former federal prosecutor, said he has retained Mr. Sitrick in cases in which “a public relations strategy became important to try to get accurate information in the public domain powerfully enough to move public opinion and change national policy.” He recently sought Mr. Sitrick’s help to protect the scoops in “Icarus,” the documentary about Olympic doping. It went on to win an Oscar.Other powerful lawyers turn to Mr. Sitrick, including Marc Kasowitz, part of President Trump’s personal legal team, who said he has used Mr. Sitrick in a “variety of large, high-profile cases.” When Mr. Kasowitz emailed a stranger with threats last July, warning him to “Watch your back, bitch,” Mr. Sitrick responded to the press inquiries that followed: “While no excuse, the email came at the end of a very long day that at 10 p.m. was not yet over.” One advantage to being retained by lawyers for a client rather than by the client himself is that Mr. Sitrick is technically a member of the legal team, and therefore protected by attorney-client privilege. And though he is not a lawyer, Mr. Sitrick views himself as a litigator in the court of public opinion. He also charges lawyerly rates — as much as $1,100 an hour.It was in early October, a couple of days after The New York Times published its first report about Harvey Weinstein, that the Hollywood producer called upon Mr. Sitrick to fix the unfixable.Mr. Weinstein had initially handled his own press, together with Lisa Bloom, the lawyer and daughter of Gloria Allred. It hadn’t gone well. “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s,” Mr. Weinstein said in an early statement, before announcing a $5 million foundation for female directors, to be named after his mother, and misquoting Jay-Z lyrics: “I’m not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children.”Mr. Sitrick, who said his memory of the initial contact is hazy, was called by Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers on Oct. 7, the day Mr. Sitrick’s mother died. He was in Chicago making funeral arrangements. It was for this reason that he passed the Weinstein case to his colleague Sallie Hofmeister, Mr. Sitrick said, not because of the optics of having a woman run things, as reports suggested. Ms. Hofmeister is a former journalist who had worked at The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. She took over on Oct. 8, the day Mr. Weinstein was fired by the Weinstein Company. Mr. Sitrick described his firm’s role in the Weinstein saga this way: “Our job was to make sure nothing was issued to the media, no statements, without clearance from the lawyers. Our job was to find out what information the reporters had, what information they wanted, go to the lawyers, tell them, and talk to the lawyers about what they wanted to say.” Ms. Hofmeister issued Sitrick and Company’s first response, on Oct. 10, when The New Yorker published an article that included accusations of rape and reported that people at the Weinstein Company knew about the misconduct. “Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,” the statement said. “Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”It went on: “Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Mr. Weinstein is hoping that, if he makes enough progress, he will be given a second chance.”That was the first and last time the firm’s statements would refer to “a second chance.” Later that day, The New York Times published another article, this one containing quotations from Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie accusing Mr. Weinstein of abuse of power.As the #MeToo dam broke, the allegations against Mr. Weinstein multiplied. So did Sitrick and Company’s rebuttals. An abridged timeline:Oct. 19: “Mr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events, but believes Lupita is a brilliant actress and a major force for the industry. Last year, she sent a personal invitation to Mr. Weinstein to see her in her Broadway show Eclipsed.”Oct. 23: “Brit Marling is a super talented actress and writer. Mr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events.”Dec. 14: “All of the sexual allegations as portrayed by Salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired.”Jan. 30: “Your piece omitted that Rose says she faked an orgasm while Mr. Weinstein was performing oral sex on her. Why? It’s misleading to leave out that part that she describes in detail in her book. Can you please update your story to include her full description of the encounter?”Feb. 3: “Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologized and deeply regrets. However her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue.”By February, more than 80 women had accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or sexual assault, and many of his business associates had spoken about a culture of complicity at his companies. Things would get even worse for Mr. Weinstein. On Feb. 11, Eric T. Schneiderman, then the New York attorney general, before he resigned after reports that he assaulted four women, filed a civil rights lawsuit against Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein was already under investigation by law enforcement in three cities. That same day, the Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy, and released all former employees from their nondisclosure agreements.Sitrick and Company issued what would turn out to be one of its final statements to USA Today, for an article on March 22: “Mr. Weinstein categorically denies ever engaging in any non-consensual sexual conduct with anyone.” Two months later Mr. Weinstein was arrested. His lawyer is Benjamin Brafman, whose clients have included Martin Shkreli, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Vincent Gigante, known as “The Chin.” Mr. Sitrick’s first book, published in 1998, is called “Spin: How to Turn the Power of the Press to Your Advantage.” He wrote it with Allan Mayer, who was a force behind the entertainment division of Sitrick and Company before he left to help found the public relations firm 42 West.In Chapter 3, “Inside the Reporter’s Head,” the authors explain that journalists are a peculiar species motivated not by money, but by an odd mix of cynicism and idealism and an egomaniacal drive to “own” a story. The authors also write: “As grubby as they may often seem, journalists are no less susceptible to the American dream than anyone else.”In Chapter 4, “News Media Abhor a Vacuum,” Mr. Sitrick lays out one of his key tenets: that strategic press representatives must engage the media; “no comment” should never be a first resort. “If you won’t talk to them, they’ll simply find someone else who will,” he and Mr. Mayer write, “which is to say, if you don’t tell your story, someone else will tell it for you.”In keeping with that rule, Mr. Sitrick quickly agreed to an interview for this article.Four days after that, as I read Chapter 7 — “Preempt the Situation” — a Google Alert appeared in my inbox, delivering what Deadline Hollywood billed as an exclusive: “Sitrick and Company Resigns Repping Disgraced Mogul Harvey Weinstein.”The Blast, a celebrity news site and TMZ spinoff, followed a few hours later with an anonymously sourced article stating that Sitrick and Company had filed for arbitration in February, after Mr. Weinstein’s bill went unpaid. “We’re told,” the article said, in the most passive voice, “that even after legal documents were filed to collect from the disgraced producer, Weinstein and his reps ‘begged’ for the firm to continue working with him. We’re told Sitrick refused.”Was Mr. Sitrick already starting to write this story? The Brentwood offices of Sitrick and Company occupy the top floor of a black building on San Vicente. Airy and immaculate, they have the feel of a law firm, but with newsroom touches. Brown leather armchairs are arranged in the reception area, where a cable-news ticker rolls silently across a screen.Mr. Sitrick’s private office is behind two security doors. There, he sat in yet another leather armchair, next to a large potted plant. Asked question after question about Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Sitrick dodged and dodged. He became a little more forthcoming when the approach took a more general tack. So, hypothetically speaking, what were reasons he might drop a client? Mr. Sitrick said he might take that step if the client treated his staff badly. He also said: “I’m not talking about any particular client, but one of the reasons we have resigned cases is people have lied to us or told us information that wasn’t true and we believe they knew it.”So it went for close to three hours. A large painting hangs above Mr. Sitrick’s desk, depicting a dozen or so people gathered behind a barricade outside the O.J. Simpson trial.The painting is not a memento. Mr. Simpson is one of few potential clients Mr. Sitrick has publicly acknowledged turning down. (Michael Jackson is another, although Mr. Sitrick has since represented his estate.)Whatever Mr. Sitrick’s affection for the painting, it loomed on that day as a reminder of the fierce whims of American public opinion — of what we will and won’t forgive, what we will and won’t forget.In this vein, did Mr. Sitrick think the #MeToo phenomenon had caused a lasting shift in American culture?To give some historical context: Twenty years ago, for example, in a Los Angeles Times article, Mr. Sitrick was asked to weigh in on the sportscaster Marv Albert, from a crisis-management point of view. (Mr. Albert was not a client.) “The problem with Marv Albert was not his roughhousing women,” Mr. Sitrick had said at the time. “The problem was the allegation that he was running around in women’s undergarments.” Today, I pointed out, it may very well be the other way around.Mr. Sitrick thought for a moment. “I think people are going to realize that they are going to be held accountable for their actions in a way that they weren’t before,” he said.To be clear, Mr. Sitrick wasn’t referring to Mr. Weinstein."
59cff51b7c459f246b62bef9,Statue’s Stolen Foot Reflects Divisions Over Symbols of Conquest,2017-09-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/us/statue-foot-new-mexico.html,The New York Times,"ALCALDE, N.M. — The mystery figure appeared at twilight at a rendezvous point in a clearing of piñon trees. He opened his rucksack and revealed plunder hidden for 20 years: the bronze right foot, including spur and stirrup, severed from a statue of Don Juan de Oñate, the despotic conquistador of New Mexico.“Tributes to the criminals of our history seem to be attracting a bit of attention these days,” said the self-described foot thief, clad in sunglasses, a kaffiyeh head covering and a floppy fishing hat. “I’m back on the scene to show people that Oñate and his supporters must be shamed.”His shadowy mien and pugnacious talk seemed more suited for coffeehouse ventilating than actual political sabotage. But to many in New Mexico and beyond, the amputation holds a great deal of significance.The mystery of Oñate’s missing foot has endured since the 1990s, feeding long-simmering tension between Hispanics and Native Americans. And just as cities, states and colleges have been grappling with Confederate monuments, acrimony over the Oñate statue reflects a broader questioning around the country of symbols promoting the conquest of American Indians.Protesters in Santa Fe on Sept. 8 disrupted an annual re-enactment of the 1692 return of Spanish forces to New Mexico after a rebellion by Pueblo Indian villagers. In California, activists have repeatedly defaced statues of Junípero Serra, an 18th-century Franciscan friar who, detractors say, eradicated indigenous cultures and caused many to die of disease.In New York City, a statue of Christopher Columbus in Central Park was vandalized, and the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, has even suggested that the explorer’s statue in Columbus Circle be removed.In New Mexico in recent days, Oñate emerged yet again as a target of scorn, when the village of Alcalde awoke to find the statue’s left foot painted red and the words “Remember 1680” — the year of the Pueblo revolt — written on the monument’s wall. And in the saga’s latest twist, the man who claims he purloined Oñate’s foot decided to come in from the cold.Twenty years ago, protesting the coming celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the first Spanish settlement in what is now the American West, operatives in a shadowy group called the Friends of Acoma took aim at the towering statue here honoring Oñate.In the dead of night on Dec. 29, 1997, they sawed off the foot, unleashing a debate over Oñate’s atrocities. While some in New Mexico admire the conquistador in ballads and pageantry, others are re-examining the brutality of Oñate’s conquest.Scholars have documented how Oñate oversaw atrocities that included the killing of 800 people in Acoma Pueblo, an ancient adobe aerie atop a 357-foot-tall sandstone mesa where the Acoma people still live today. Dozens of Acoma girls were parceled out to convents in Mexico City, and adolescents were sentenced to decades of servitude. In a notorious act of cruelty, Oñate is said to have ordered his men to cut a foot off at least 24 male captives.Chris Eyre, a Cheyenne-Arapaho filmmaker who is well known in Santa Fe, said that the foot abductor recently walked up to him while he was at a local eatery, La Choza, digging into a bowl of posole. “He handed me a note, and I thought to myself, is this one of those Roswell types?” said Mr. Eyre, 48, referring to the conspiracy-minded U.F.O. trackers who convene in the New Mexico desert.Still, Mr. Eyre, the director of “Skins,” a 2002 film that ends with a depiction of red paint being thrown on George Washington’s face at Mount Rushmore, was intrigued by the story of the foot. Now Mr. Eyre is developing a documentary exploring how the amputation triggered an exploration of New Mexico’s complex history.“Trump asked if all this stops with Washington or Jefferson,” said Mr. Eyre, referring to the president’s comparison in August of removing statues to “changing history.” “For me, that’s actually where it starts because we need to go back a whole lot further to examine the crimes upon which these lands were claimed.”Mr. Eyre arranged an encounter in September between this reporter and the thief, a wiry figure who trekked to the remote meeting point carrying his piece of Oñate. Chafing at celebrations of the Spanish conquest while describing his own Iroquois ancestry, the thief said he carried out the amputation in 1997 with just one comrade, a native New Mexican, in solidarity with the Acoma people.He requested that their identities remain secret, explaining that he had no desire to go to jail. “Mysteries are sometimes best kept a little mysterious,” he said. “I smile at the possibility that this tale of defiance could someday be told from campfire to campfire.”The theft of the foot already resonates among scholars and writers who have explored the ramifications of the act. Maurus Chino, 63, an Acoma artisan, said, “The Oñate statue is simply racist and obscene.”“When the foot was cut off, I didn’t hear one person from Acoma disagree with that act,” Mr. Chino said. “If monuments like these can’t be taken down, maybe it’s time to cut some more feet off.”Others, however, argue that criticism of the statue drives a wedge between peoples who lived side by side, sometimes in discord but often intermarrying, for centuries.For some Hispanics, statues of Oñate and other conquistadors amount to their own symbols of resistance, in the face of the dominance that Anglos have often wielded in New Mexico since the 19th century. Emilio Naranjo, at the time the powerful Democratic Party boss here, secured funds to build the statue in the 1990s as part of a project to honor Hispanic culture. After the dismemberment, its sculptor, Sonny Rivera, cast a replacement foot for Oñate at a cost to taxpayers of $10,000, and it was welded on.Thomas Romero, executive director of the Northern Rio Grande Heritage Area, whose office is in the same complex as the statue, even wondered if Oñate’s cruelty had been a bit exaggerated. Mr. Romero speculated whether Oñate’s men could have meted out retaliation by cutting off toes instead of feet.“Some people have pointed out that it would be foolish to cut off the whole foot of people who would be your servants,” Mr. Romero said. Still, he contended that the intensifying discussion over the statue shows why the complexities of Oñate’s era, as well as our own, need to be examined.Mr. Romero said he was seeking to forge stronger ties between Hispanics and Native Americans by flying the flag of the nearby Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo above the Oñate statue, alongside the flags of New Mexico, Rio Arriba County and the United States. He said he was also promoting exchanges that exemplify the historical bonds between Native Americans and Hispanics, including an event featuring the Genízaros, descendants of captured Indians who were raised in Hispanic culture.Scholars, meanwhile, are unearthing new details about Oñate himself. Unlike the first conquistadors, Oñate wasn’t born in Spain, but in 1550 in what is today Zacatecas in north-central Mexico, and is thought by some researchers to have indigenous ancestry on his mother’s side, according to Michael Trujillo, a professor of American studies at the University of New Mexico.Either way, Oñate’s methods were contentious even in an era known for its excesses. Mounting criticism forced the conquistador to resign as New Mexico’s governor in 1610 and, in 1614, he was found guilty by the viceroy on charges of abusing his power. Centuries later, the divisiveness around Oñate persists.“While visitor bureau types like to sell Northern New Mexico as a mix of cultures, it’s far from that,” Robert Trapp, the publisher of the Rio Grande Sun in the nearby town of Española, wrote in September. “The racism here is real, multidirectional and simmers just below the surface.”Forget the 21st century, Mr. Trapp suggested. “These separate cultures, maintaining covert contempt for each other, is one of the many things that keeps us from moving into the 1980s,” he said.The foot thief smiled when discussing how his act of sabotage was stirring ghosts. He has melted down a portion of the foot to make medallions for Pueblo leaders, but otherwise it remains mostly as it was when he sawed it off. “I always wanted to walk the foot all the way to Acoma,” he said. “Or maybe it’ll get buried as a time capsule.”“Not the spur, though,” he said, explaining how he planned to keep a trophy from his act. “That will be mine forever.”"
58ab62017c459f2525d1d8f5,Does Bigfoot Have a Soul? A Radio Host’s Audience Ponders,2017-02-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/business/media/coast-to-coast-am-george-noory.html,The New York Times,"When the C.I.A. released hundreds of thousands of declassified files online in January, the contents probably seemed far-fetched to most people. Included in the cache were documents about U.F.O. sightings, demonstrations of psychic abilities and reports of a Georgian man with magical healing powers.But those subjects would have seemed almost passé to the radio host George Noory and the curious nocturnal listeners who tune in to his radio show, “Coast to Coast AM.”Mr. Noory, 66, has been hosting the nationally syndicated program for 14 years from his studios in Los Angeles and St. Louis. With three million weekly listeners, “Coast to Coast,” which is broadcast every night from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. Eastern time, is carried by more than 600 radio stations in North America and is by far the most popular overnight radio program in the country, according to information from Nielsen.Given the size of its audience, the show might be expected to cover topics squarely in the mainstream. But Mr. Noory’s listeners, whom he refers to as “the night people,” tend to focus more on fringier fare, whether it’s U.F.O. sightings near Area 51 or the myriad conspiracy theories that Mr. Noory’s predecessor, Art Bell, established as signatures of the program.“Most of the folks during the daytime will generally take whatever is handed to them,” Mr. Noory said.Not his listeners.“Skepticism in my view is very healthy,” said Mr. Noory, who considers himself a libertarian. “I think everybody needs to be skeptical about just about everything, until they have either done their own homework, done their own research or accepted information from sources that they trust, like The New York Times, or like The Wall Street Journal, or like Matt Drudge, if they trust him, as well.”Mr. Noory worked in television news for 34 years, as a reporter, a producer and an executive at stations in Detroit, Minneapolis and St. Louis. But his interest in unexplained phenomena developed early. He has said many times that he had an out-of-body experience when he was 11, and described the episode again in a recent interview.“I was bouncing up on the ceiling looking down on my body,” he said.“Coast to Coast” began in 1984 as a talk radio program broadcasting from the Las Vegas station KDWN. Mr. Bell, its founder and first host, had originally been a D.J. He switched his focus to talk radio at a time when music listeners began to favor higher-fidelity FM stations, forcing many AM channels to switch formats. When “Coast to Coast” went national, in 1992, he started to receive calls from listeners about their paranormal experiences. Those calls soon became the show’s trademark.When Mr. Bell left the show, he advised Mr. Noory not to imitate his hosting style, which gave listeners the (accurate) sense that he was broadcasting from a compound in the desert. He was isolated from his audience and occasionally confrontational with callers.On one call from a man claiming to have worked for Area 51, Mr. Bell made his suspicion known right away: “Well, look, let’s begin by finding out whether you’re using this line properly or not.” And on Oct. 13, 1998, Mr. Bell signed off by saying: “This is it, folks. I’m going off the air and will not return.” When Mr. Noory took over, after his forerunner returned and vanished from the show a few more times, listeners noticed a shift in tone, from skeptical and sometimes critical to open-minded and kind.“Art was a little more, if he thought you were loo-la, he would tell you,” said Veronica Costin, who started tuning in during the 1990s. It became a ritual for her: drifting off in her San Antonio bedroom to the sounds of faraway voices.“There’s a community,” she said. “We’re all there in that dark. We’re all there in that quiet.”Mrs. Costin and her husband, who died in December, listened to “Coast to Coast” every night, even as his health was deteriorating. The possibilities that the show raises, like the afterlife, have been a comfort for Mrs. Costin in her grief.“My husband is dead,” she said. “I cannot give you anything you can write down on paper and prove, but I know he is not gone.”Christian MacLeod of Asheville, N.C., has been a nightly listener since 1995. He grew up hearing stories from his grandfather about unexplained phenomena and watching Leonard Nimoy’s “In Search Of,” always wondering, what if?“Can I just give an example?” Mr. MacLeod said. “If Bigfoot’s real — you know where I live, there’s a lot of Bigfoot sightings around here — if Bigfoot’s real, what would that do to, say, religion, the economy, all these other things that touch that? Let’s just say the DNA on Bigfoot is half-human. Does he have a soul? It helps you think.”Nolan Higdon, a professor of history and communication at California State University, East Bay, sees programs that propagate unsubstantiated claims as potentially dangerous.“People sit down and think that they watch or listen to or consume media, and that it’s just entertainment,” he said. “But inside any entertainment are certain values, ideas, concepts, representations. They dictate things to you and the way you see the world, whether you’re aware of it or not.”Each episode of “Coast to Coast” begins with a news segment, but when asked if he saw himself as a journalist, Mr. Noory responded that he was “a facilitator of the truth, wherever that takes us.”His audience seems to see him as an authoritative, unifying force at a time when the country appears more fragmented than ever. Through his radio show, live events and two dating sites — Paranormal Date and Conspiracy Date — he acts as a connector and a surrogate for his listeners, whom he considers extended family. (Mr. Noory has three children and six grandchildren. He is private about his relationship status.)To uphold the appearance of impartiality, Mr. Noory said, he has abstained from voting since joining “Coast to Coast.” “I want to be able to go on the air and say, ‘Folks, I don’t have a favorite here,’” he said. But that doesn’t prevent him from making projections.On July 27, Mr. Noory appeared on Alex Jones’s show on the website Infowars and predicted that Donald J. Trump would win the presidential election. Mr. Jones, who is a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump, is also a conspiracy theorist who has drawn intense criticism for, among other things, questioning whether the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut could be a hoax.Mr. Noory said in a recent phone interview that he had noticed a significant change in his audience, and in the general population, over the last 15 years.“I have never seen a time period where more people are upset, concerned, scared, ticked off, about so many things,” he said. “That’s probably why Donald Trump got elected. There’s an uneasiness of something impending.”A frequent caller, Jonathan Christian Webster III, who refers to himself as J. C. on the air, illustrates the extreme of the fear that Mr. Noory hears from his audience. The forces J. C. believes are contributing to America’s decline include pornography, William Shatner and Canada. (Maybe not coincidentally, Mr. Shatner is a native Canadian.)Mr. Noory is an empathetic listener, even to the views of people like Mr. Webster. But he also says he believes that it is important to question what you hear. For that reason, he occasionally invites guests on his show who challenge some of his listeners’ beliefs.Joe Nickell, senior research fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, has dedicated his career to exploring possible explanations for mysterious phenomena. He has appeared on the show occasionally as a voice of skepticism.“What I’m trying to do is actually investigate claims, like Bigfoot or ghosts or any of the other bizarre topics ‘Coast to Coast’ deals with,” Mr. Nickell said. “I’m confident that if I can actually explain some mystery, the debunking will take care of itself.”Mr. Noory has no plans to retire and remains open to any topic that a guest would like to introduce to the “Coast to Coast” audience.“I think everything has a possibility,” he said. “Even as far-fetched as it may sound, there’s always some possibility that it’s real. Are there other dimensions? I don’t know. But it’s possible.”"

In “The Roswell Report: Case Closed,” officials wrote that any “aliens” spotted in the desert “were actually anthropomorphic test dummies” carried aloft by high-altitude Air Force balloons.As for Mr. Brazel, he didn’t believe the debris was a weather balloon, but he regretted setting off the furor.In the future, he said, “If I find anything else besides a bomb, they are going to have a hard time getting me to say anything about it.”Evan Gershkovich contributed reporting._____Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

59759ff87c459f246b61a93f,‘Make It So’: ‘Star Trek’ and Its Debt to Revolutionary Socialism,2017-07-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/opinion/make-it-so-star-trek-and-its-debt-to-revolutionary-socialism.html,The New York Times,"H. G. Wells’s foundational work of political science fiction, “The Time Machine,” predicted a future in which a small utopia of sprightly elites is kept running by a subclass that lives below the ground and is reduced to bestial violence. This prediction, carried to a horrifically logical extent, represented the intense wealth disparity of the Victorian England in which Wells wrote the novel. Judging from the major political narratives of the fictions of our era, films like “The Hunger Games,” “Elysium” and “Snowpiercer,” the certainty of a future rendered increasingly barbarous by class division remains essentially the same.But this was not always the case. In 1920, Wells met Vladimir Lenin, a fellow world-building visionary who planned “the inauguration of an age of limitless experiment” to rebuild and industrialize his country from ruination by years of war, abolishing class society in the process. Wells was impressed by the pragmatic revolutionary and his planned “utopia of electricians.”If Wells had been less skeptical of Communism and joined the party, he wouldn’t have been the first sci-fi or futurist thinker to do so. Alexander Bogdanov, an early political rival of Lenin’s, wrote “Red Star,” a utopian novel about a Communist colony on Mars where everything was held in common and life spans were greatly extended through the use of parabiosis, the mutual sharing of blood. Along with Anatoly Lunacharsky and Maxim Gorky, Bogdanov proposed a program of “God Building,” which would replace the rituals and myths of the Orthodox Church through creation of an atheistic religion.For his part, Gorky was a fan of the Cosmism of Nikolai Fyodorov and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a scientific and mystical philosophy proposing space exploration and human immortality. When Lenin died four years after meeting with Wells, the futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky’s line “Lenin Lived, Lenin Lives, Lenin Will Live Forever!” became not only a state slogan, but also a scientific goal. These Biocosmist-Immortalists, as they were known, believed that socialist scientists, freed from the constraints of the capitalist profit motive, would discover how to abolish death and bring back their comrades. Lenin’s corpse remains preserved for the occasion.Bogdanov died in the course of his blood-sharing experiments, and other futurist dreams were sidelined by the industrial and militarist priorities that led up to World War II. In the postwar period, however, scientists inspired by Cosmism launched Sputnik. The satellite’s faint blinking in the night sky signaled an era of immense human potential to escape all limitations natural and political, with the equal probability of destroying everything in a matter of hours.Feeding on this tension, science fiction and futurism entered their “golden age” by the 1950s and ’60s, both predicting the bright future that would replace the Cold War. Technological advances would automate society; the necessity of work would fade away. Industrial wealth would be distributed as a universal basic income, and an age of leisure and vitality would follow. Humans would continue to voyage into space, creating off-Earth colonies and perhaps making new, extraterrestrial friends in the process. In a rare 1966 collaboration across the Iron Curtain, the astronomer Carl Sagan co-wrote “Intelligent Life in the Universe” with Iosif Shklovosky. This work of astrobiological optimism proposed that humans attempt to contact their galactic neighbors.Interest in alien life was not just the domain of scientists and fiction writers. U.F.O. flaps worldwide captured pop cultural attention, and many believed that flying saucers were here to warn us, or even save us, from the danger of nuclear weapons. In the midst of the worldwide worker and student uprisings in 1968, the Argentine Trotskyist leader known as J. Posadas wrote an essay proposing solidarity between the working class and the alien visitors. He argued that their technological advancement indicated they would be socialists and could deliver us the technology to free Earth from the grip of Yankee imperialism and the bureaucratic workers’ states.Such views were less fringe and more influential than you might think. Beginning in 1966, the plot of “Star Trek” closely followed Posadas’s propositions. After a nuclear third world war (which Posadas also believed would lead to socialist revolution), Vulcan aliens visit Earth, welcoming them into a galactic federation and delivering replicator technology that would abolish scarcity. Humans soon unify as a species, formally abolishing money and all hierarchies of race, gender and class.“A lot has changed in the past 300 years,” Captain Picard explains to a cryogenically unfrozen businessman from the 20th century in an episode of a later “Star Trek” franchise, “The Next Generation.” “People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We’ve eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We’ve grown out of our infancy.”For all its continued popularity, such optimism was unusual in the genre. The new wave of sci-fi in the late ’60s, typified by J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick in the United States and by the Strugatsky brothers and Stanislaw Lem in the East, presented narratives that undercut this theme of humans’ saving themselves through their own rationality.The grand proposals of the ’60s futurists also faded away, as the Fordist period of postwar economic growth abruptly about-faced. Instead of automation and guaranteed income, workers got austerity and deregulation. The Marxist theorist Franco Berardi described this period as one in which an inherent optimism for the future, implied by socialism and progressivism, faded into the “no future” nihilism of neoliberalism and Thatcherite economics, which insisted that “there is no alternative.”The fall of the Soviet Union cemented this “end of history,” in Francis Fukuyama’s phrase, and signaled a return to late-capitalist dystopian narratives of the future, like that of “The Time Machine.” Two of the most popular sci-fi films of the ’90s were “Terminator 2” and “The Matrix,” which both showcased a world in which capital had triumphed and its machinery would not liberate mankind, but govern it. The recent success of “The Road,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Walking Dead” similarly predict violent futures where only small underground resistance movements struggle to keep the dying flame of humanity alight.Released the same year as “Star Trek: First Contact” — and grossing three times as much — “Independence Day” told a story directly opposed to Posadism, in which those who gather to greet the aliens and protest military engagement with them are the first to be incinerated by the extraterrestrials’ directed-energy weapons. (In Wells’s 1897 vision of alien invasion, “The War of the Worlds,” the white flag-waving welcoming party of humans is similarly dispatched.)The grotesque work of 1970s white supremacist speculative fiction, “The Camp of the Saints” by Jean Raspail — recently referenced by the White House strategist Steve Bannon — has a similar story line. A fleet of refugee ships appears off the coast of France, asking for safe harbor, but it soon becomes apparent that the ship is a Trojan horse. Its admission triggers an invasion of Europe and the United States.The recent rise of right-wing populism indicates a widening crack in the neoliberal consensus of ideological centrism. From this breach, past visions of the future are once again pouring out. Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg feel empowered to propose science fiction premises, like space colonization and post-scarcity economics, as solutions to actual social problems. Absent, however, are the mass social movements of the 20th century calling for the democratization of social wealth and politics. While rapid changes in the social order that are the dream of Silicon Valley’s disruptors are acquiring an aura of inevitability, a world absent of intense poverty and bigoted hostility feels unimaginable.Shortly after World War II, Wells became so convinced of humanity’s doom, without a world revolution, that he revised the last chapter of “A Short History of the World” to include the extinction of mankind. Today we are left with a similar fatalism, allowing the eliminiationist suggestions of the far right to argue, in effect, for a walling-off of the world along lines of class, nationality and race, even if this might condemn millions to death.If humanity in the 21st century is to be rescued from its tailspin descent into the abyss, we must recall the choice offered by the alien visitor from the 1951 sci-fi film classic “The Day the Earth Stood Still.”“Join us and live in peace,” Klaatu said, “or pursue your present course and face obliteration.”I think of it as science fiction’s useful paraphrasing of Rosa Luxemburg’s revolutionary ultimatum: “socialism or barbarism.”"

Some say he is abroad; others say he is dead. But the military government of Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha is still on a manhunt for Phra Dhammachayo, the controversial spiritual leader of the Dhammakaya movement, a powerful Buddhist sect.For 23 days, the Thai police blocked access to the sprawling Dhammakaya compound outside Bangkok and raided it in search of its former abbot. Phra Dhammachayo is wanted for embezzlement and money laundering, among other things. The temple’s spokesman has denied the accusations; the abbot’s supporters claim the charges are politically motivated.But the curious saga of this possibly wayward cleric is also, or mostly, about the ruling junta’s growing insecurity. To stamp out dissent, the military government is now willing to openly trespass into the religious sphere and clamp down on a very popular Buddhist leader. And this story may soon become a cautionary tale.Dhammakaya is the biggest and most influential temple in Thailand. It has gained traction, especially among lower-middle classes, thanks to a kind of Buddhist prosperity gospel that advocates meditation, volunteering and donations. It repackages traditional Buddhist concepts in accessible form, including carnival-like pilgrimages and TV shows. Its main building looks like a giant U.F.O. Dhammakaya is said to have three million followers, including powerful politicians and businesspeople.Members of the royal family appear to have sponsored the sect, and are thought to have helped pay for buildings at its main compound. But the movement is better known for its suspected ties to the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in a military coup in 2006, and to his sister Yingluck, who was ousted by the current junta, in 2014, after she, too, became prime minister.Phra Dhammachayo was charged with embezzlement in the late 1990s and removed from his position. But he was cleared of the charges and reinstated as abbot after Mr. Thaksin became prime minister. Many Shinawatra supporters, better known as the red shirts, are hardcore loyalists of Phra Dhammachayo.Much like Mr. Thaksin challenged the political domination of the traditional Thai elites — namely royalists, the military and big business — Dhammakaya’s brash form of Buddhism threatens the belief system of Thai conservatives. Together the Shinawatras and this sect seem to erode traditional forms of authority, and so in the junta’s view, must be quieted.Buddhism is one prong of the holy trinity that makes Thai identity, alongside the nation and the monarchy. It is the state religion, and a compulsory subject of study in public schools. The king is considered to be Buddhism’s ultimate patron and the gatekeeper of the Sangha, the Buddhist monastic order.Tensions between Dhammakaya and the Prayuth government were bound to come to a head after the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October. Bhumibol had ruled for seven decades, partly by forging strong ties with the military and Bangkok-based elites. But in recent years the Shinawatras defied those traditional networks, tacitly challenging the king’s moral authority, by appealing to rural voters with populist projects. The military arguably staged the 2014 coup in the hope of steering the impending royal succession in ways that would safeguard the interests of the establishment. Now it is trying to control the Buddhist establishment as well.It so happened that as Bhumibol’s health was faltering last year and the question of his succession became a pressing concern, the conservative elites had to worry about another passing of the guard: The Supreme Patriarch, the head of the monks’ order, died in 2013 and had yet to be replaced.Traditionally, the country’s top religious position goes to the most senior monk designated by the Sangha Supreme Council, the Buddhist order’s governing body. In this instance, the presumptive heir was Somdet Phra Maha Ratchamangalacharn, better known as Somdet Chuang. But the Prayuth government blocked his nomination by invoking a tax evasion scandal involving vintage cars. More to the point perhaps, Somdet Chuang was a mentor to Phra Dhammachayo and he enjoys massive support among Thaksin supporters.In January, the government amended the Sangha succession law to give the king sole power to appoint the Supreme Patriarch. In February, Maha Vajiralongkorn, the new king, chose Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong, the abbot of a competing sect, circumventing the Sangha Council.Then on March 5, the government issued a royal command, signed by the king, stripping Phra Dhammachayo of his religious titles.Are the new king and the military working in tandem? Who knows. Almost three years after the coup, Thai politics remains precarious and very opaque. Vajiralongkorn has asked for revisions to a junta-drafted constitution that was approved by referendum last year; a form of horse-trading may be underway. The controversial constitution has yet to come into force, and pending that, the date of the next election, already many times delayed, remains uncertain.One major question is how long the Thai people will stand for this, especially if the Prayuth government starts cracking down on religious leaders. At the height of the recent siege at the Dhammakaya complex, several thousand monks and supporters stayed in the compound to protest the raid. The standoff was the most high-profile mass demonstration against the junta since the 2014 coup.The generals’ tough stance hardly is surprising given their insistence on quashing critics in the past. But their failure to eradicate Mr. Thaksin’s influence has probably made him stronger, and if their attack on Dhammakaya, and meddling in religious affairs, was an attempt to tighten their grip on power, they may well come out the weaker for it."
5ae44623068401528a2ab370,"David Duchovny’s Truth Is Out There, Between Covers",2018-04-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/style/david-duchovny.html,The New York Times,"I’m a sucker for a man who reads Yeats. So I’m bound to like a man who bases his novel on an obscure Yeats play.“When I was at Yale in graduate school, a friend of mine brought me to see a play that the undergraduates were doing and it was ‘The Only Jealousy of Emer,’” David Duchovny recalls one rainy day over lattes at Tavern on the Green. “It’s a verse play, so it’s kind of unwatchable. But I got the gist of it, which was a very cool wager about love, and it stayed with me forever.”Naturally, since this is Fox Mulder of “The X-Files,” there’s a supernatural element and a parallel universe. And since this is also Hank Moody of “Californication,” there’s some drinking and womanizing, too.In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, Emer and the warrior hero Cu Chulainn fall in love and marry after trading cryptic riddles. The Yeats play conjures a moment when Cu Chulainn inadvertently kills his own son in battle and then, distraught, begins fighting “the deathless sea” and almost drowns. A demonic Irish fairy, called a Sidhe, appears and offers Emer a cruel bargain: If she gives up her fondest hope that the warrior will tire of his mistress — also at his sickbed — and grow old with her, the fairy will let Cu Chulainn live. “He’ll never sit beside you at the hearth,” the Sidhe tells Emer, “Or make old bones, but die of wounds and toil, on some far shore or mountain, a strange woman beside his mattress.” After agonizing over the choice, Emer finally says, “If he may live I am content.”In “Miss Subways,” published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Mr. Duchovny modernizes this myth into the tale of Emer Gunnels, a 41-year-old New York schoolteacher who likes to take the subway and eat ice cream and make love with her boyfriend, Cuchulain, a writer known as Con. But a troublemaking pint-size doorman, Sid, who is a Sidhe, shows up at her apartment one night with a cruel bargain: Emer can save her boyfriend from being hit by a car outside Nobu, where he is out flirting with another woman. But Emer has to give him up, along with her dream of walking arm in arm with Con on the beach when they are old. Mr. Duchovny, 57, says the hardest thing about putting out a novel in the age of Trump is Trump. Or, to purloin a line from his novel: Are we all characters in a Beckett play directed by Sartre? “Every time I’m talking about something that’s not politics or Trump, it feels insignificant, like child’s play,” he says, calling the president “the single most reprehensible human being I’ve witnessed in real time.”Perhaps since President Trump prefers hiring good-looking people he has seen on TV on the Fox channel, Mr. Duchovny may be in line for a job. “The first internet sex symbol with hair,” as I once called him, is sporting stubble, a black cardigan over a striped T-shirt, black pants and shoes from the Canadian company Roots.“I’m waiting for a call,” he says. “I could be the next director of the F.B.I.” In one of the shows in “The X-Files” reboot on Fox, an alien comes down an escalator and announces plans to build a great, magnetic wall to keep humans out of the rest of the universe.I note that the president may be the only person who is more paranoid and conspiracy-minded and worried about the Deep State than Spooky Mulder.“I do have a Deep State hoodie from the Samantha Bee show,” Mr. Duchovny says.The president and Mr. Duchovny have one more similarity: Both have Scottish mothers. (The actor refers to himself as a “macaroon,” because his mother is Scottish and his father was Jewish.)“I talked to my mother about it. I said, ‘Can you believe Trump’s mom is Scottish?’ and she’s horrified,” he said, adding that since his mother came to New York by marrying his Brooklyn-born dad: “I’m an anchor baby.” He says about the man he calls “Orange Julius”: “I don’t think it matters if there’s a pee-pee tape because that’s not what makes him unfit to be president. Nor does his horrible attitude toward women make him unfit to be president. His attitude towards human society and the environment and everything else makes him unfit to be president.” Mr. Duchovny has called Fox Mulder “the worst F.B.I. agent of all time” because he never solved one case in nine years. What does he think about Mr. Trump tweeting that James Comey was “the worst F.B.I. director in history, by far!”“Comey seems like an honest guy, maybe too honest in a way or maybe too proud of his honesty,” Mr. Duchovny said. “He’s like a Joseph Conrad hero from the 19th century. He’d be a tragic figure in another time.”Since Russians are among Mr. Duchovny’s biggest fans — he made an ad for a nonalcoholic Russian beer called Siberian Crown several years ago, playing a cosmonaut — I wonder what he makes of the Trump-Putin relationship.“I don’t think Putin needs anything on him,” Mr. Duchovny said of the blackmail rumors. “Putin just needs to strut around in front of Trump and do the horrible things he does and Trump is going to admire that.” He doesn’t get into politics in his book because he thinks it can slide too easily into propaganda, although he has some zingers. He refers to President Trump as “a hybrid monstrosity,” Rudy Giuliani as “that lispy, hissy, death’s head of a mayor” and Sean Hannity as “that pinched-faced thumb in a real-hair toupee.’’He makes a slighting reference to “Penceville” in the novel, so I ask him about the vice president’s draconian attitude toward gay people and the strange way he calls his wife “Mother.”“I could sit here and try to be Mike Pence’s armchair psychologist, but clearly something happened that he hasn’t dealt with, and I wish him luck,” Mr. Duchovny says. “I wish he didn’t use the United States as a canvas upon which to work it out.”I wonder what Mr. Duchovny made of the story broken by The New York Times in December, revealing that the Pentagon had a shadowy $22 million U.F.O. program, with most of the money going to an aerospace research company run by a billionaire who said he was “absolutely convinced” that aliens exist and have visited earth.“When it happened,” Mr. Duchovny deadpanned, “I said that I was finally really impressed by the Fox publicity department, that they were able to plant a story like that to sell the show.”He dropped out of Yale before writing his Ph.D dissertation, which was to be “Magic and Technology in Contemporary American Fiction and Poetry.” (His senior thesis at Princeton was titled “The Schizophrenic Critique of Pure Reason in Beckett’s Early Novels.”) Like his 2004 movie, “House of D,” which he wrote and directed, his new novel is a meditation on his hometown — “So much of New York involved looking away” — and his heroine, Emer, has many of the same traits as Mr. Duchovny.Like her creator, Emer has green eyes with different-sized pupils, which reflect “some charismatic, universal, lighthearted melancholy, like she saw things at a distance, a gently ironic remove.” She’s a reader, “it defined her.” She does not “like to kill anything and has been an on-and-off, semi-strict, nondogmatic, occasional vegetarian since college.’’ (But she makes an exception on the killing ban for mosquitoes and really good sushi.) She thinks Twitter is the end of the world. And she is a schoolteacher, like Mr. Duchovny’s mother, Meg, who was a cherished teacher at Grace Church School in Greenwich Village and his sister, Laurie, who is a teacher at St. Ann’s in Brooklyn.The book is dedicated to his 88-year-old mother, and he has Con tell Emer a story that actually happened to Mr. Duchovny and his mom when he was a boy eager to see the dinosaurs at the Museum of Natural History. They missed their subway stop and ended up, flummoxed, in Queens. As Mr. Duchovny writes in his dedication: “Our curiosity and incompetence taught us it’s not the destination, it’s the ride … stay on the train, the scenery will change.’’ The author, who has written two previous novels, has no trouble slipping into the female voice. He was a jock who dreamed of playing basketball at Princeton, which he did for a year on the junior varsity team before “the heartbreak” of no longer being on the team. But he was professionally gender-fluid before that term became popular. He suggested a plotline to his friend Garry Shandling for “The Larry Sanders Show” in which he played himself hitting on Mr. Shandling, doing the Sharon Stone opening-the-kimono reveal. On “Twin Peaks,” he played an undercover detective in drag named Dennis who liked it so much he transitioned into Denise.“High heels and tights and underwire bras are painful,” Mr. Duchovny says with a grimace. “I had marks, I had bruises. It’s not fun.”His father, a publicist and writer, left and moved to Boston when Mr. Duchovny was young. The way he, his brother and sister were raised by his mother, he says, made him think that “there was no difference between men and women — not intellectual, emotional, spiritual. I’m aware that I don’t understand what it’s like to be a woman, be attacked as a woman, to feel endangered as a woman, to be abused as a woman. But I feel like I could hear Emer’s voice in my head. And I know ‘appropriation’ is a dirty word these days, but that’s all an artist can do. I mean, there is no art without appropriation. You take what you find and you make a collage and you imagine the rest.“You want me to imagine what it’s like to be a woman, to put myself in a black man’s shoes or a black woman’s shoes,” he says. “That’s actually what we all should be trying to do, whether or not we come up with a nice work of fiction from it or it’s horrible and you got it all wrong. I really feel like the wrong way to go about it is to try to imagine that there are some movies that should be told by women as opposed to by men. And so a woman can direct any movie and a man can direct any movie and you hope you can get it to a meritocracy at some point. If you say, ‘No, you can’t do that,’ then you’re shutting down exactly the impulse that you want to come out of this bomb that went off in our culture.”After the Harvey Weinstein revelations, he said, he had to “re-educate” himself. He said his belief in equality between men and women and blacks and whites skewed his perception of the fundamental nature of the problem. “So my education has been to acknowledge that even if I didn’t perpetuate it, it has to be dealt with — if I’m not being part of the solution I’m being part of the problem,” he says, adding that witnessing all the hatred and division that has cascaded since the advent of Trump has “reopened” his eyes to misogyny and racism.Gillian Anderson has complained that after struggling for years to get equal pay for playing Scully — initially, as a newcomer, the actress was even told to stand several feet behind Mr. Duchovny in scenes — she was at first offered half of Mr. Duchovny’s salary for “The X-Files” revival. When I mention that only 4 percent of women directed the top 100 grossing films, he shakes his head, murmuring, “That’s mind-blowing.” For a long time, Mr. Duchovny was touted as the next George Clooney. “I envisioned a career more in movies, but we all did at that point,” he says. “Now the business has changed, where everybody’s doing television. I felt like I could have collaborated better. I could have sought out people more who were better than me. I could have gone to more parties. I could have been more social. “I would never complain about a career like mine because I feel like that’s silly, but certainly there were times where I was just feeling like, damn, you know, ‘Why am I not doing that?’ or ‘Why am I not getting this?’ I wish that ‘House of D’ would have been accepted in a different way. I feel like I’ll continue to direct.” He plans to direct a film of his second novel, “Bucky Dent” (the full title includes a profane middle name for Dent), another one inspired by his own life, about a son making peace with a distant father who is dying.Mr. Duchovny, whose Twitter biography at one point was simply “Dilettante,” has also gotten a band together and he has made two albums, “Hell or High Water” and “Every Third Thought.” Rolling Stone described his first album as “lyrically tart” and “vaguely Wilco-ish.” Critics were less kind to the second album. A Jezebel post was headlined: “I Wish Aliens Would Abduct David Duchovny’s New Rock Album.”“I think people like you to stay in your lane and it’s easy to take potshots at me for dabbling, I imagine, but that’s O.K.,” he says, adding that he is waiting for the “Not bad for an actor” reviews of his book.After his divorce from the actress Téa Leoni in 2014, he learned to play guitar, asking the writers of “Californication” to weave in Hank’s playing “so I could get free guitar lessons from the show.”He has gotten points for being humble and accepting that he’s putting out what A.V. Club’s Sean O’Neal calls “perfectly serviceable famous-dad-rock.”I ask if a song on his first album that mentions a 12-step program — “Three thousand steps, forget about 12” — alludes to his 2008 stint in a sex-addiction clinic, an attempt to save his 17-year marriage to Ms. Leoni, with whom he has an 19-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old son.  “Yeah,” he says. “I think there’s wisdom to be had in looking at any kind of behaviors that we do to manage our unease and make ourselves feel better or to alter our consciousness.”He has, however, given up therapy, because shrinks tend to shrink, as he likes to say, a line he says he borrowed from his old Yale professor Harold Bloom.Poignantly, his ring finger still has a wedding tattoo, of the letters AYSF, which stand for At Your Side Forever. “But people think the AYSF is American Youth Soccer Foundation and I tell them, ‘Yes, that’s it,’” Mr. Duchovny says. “I’m a big fan of the game.”Two different men who are eating lunch at the restaurant stop by to say they loved “Californication.” I ask if he has any similarities to Hank, whom Mr. Duchovny has described as a guy who knows the right thing to do but can’t get himself in a position to do it.“What I loved about that character is that he was a truth teller,” he says. “He was a fantasy, the guy who always speaks his mind and that’s a fun character to play.”I ask Mr. Duchovny about the influence of pornography in the culture. He started his career as the narrator and occasional star of Zalman King’s “Red Shoe Diaries” on Showtime, which popularized erotica on late-night cable.“I’ve got kids and they deal with the explosion of porn and the internet, so I’ve had to think about it for sure,” he says. “I think it’s dangerous because there’s no more innocence. There’s no chance for a child who has had no sexual experience not to have seen the most extreme sexual experiences that human bodies can offer. That child no longer has the option of figuring his or her way through that themselves. When you have the porn discussion with your kids, you should say: ‘You’re really good at science, but I wouldn’t want you practicing brain surgery at 14. Those guys are professionals. There’s reasons why I wouldn’t want you watching that — the same reason I wouldn’t want to put you in the operating room right now. You’ve got to develop yourself to get to a certain point.’” I try a question on Mr. Duchovny that was asked of me recently.Who would you like to collaborate with, have a drink with and have a conversation with (alive or dead)? “I would pick Paul Thomas Anderson to collaborate with,” he says. He would like to have a drink with René Girard, the late French philosopher who is also a favorite of Peter Thiel’s.“Girard was talking about mimesis, that humans are monkey see, monkey do,” he says. “That makes sense to me.”And he would like to have a conversation with Jesus. “When Jesus said, ‘Turn the other cheek,’ it was a revolution in human consciousness,” Mr. Duchovny says. “Did he just wake up and think of that? I’d like to know.”I can actually visualize Jesus meeting up with Mr. Duchovny in Los Angeles for some yoga and vegetarian fare, hitting a juice bar on Melrose Avenue.“He’d have a man bun now,” Mr. Duchovny says. “And washboard abs,” I say. “And he’d be doing that P90X workout, that thing that Paul Ryan does,” Mr. Duchovny adds.The sun has finally come out. And Mr. Duchovny goes out to have his picture taken among the bright yellow and pink blossoms in Central Park. But he still manages to look noir. "
597ebce27c459f246b61bd47,"‘Twin Peaks’ Season 3, Episode 12: Hornes Aplenty",2017-07-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/arts/television/twin-peaks-season-3-episode-12-recap.html,The New York Times,"Because “Twin Peaks” doesn’t take place in the “real world” per se, it’s been fascinating in this revival to see just what aspects of modern life David Lynch and Mark Frost see fit to include in their story. I’ve already mentioned the unusually futuristic computers in the otherwise retro Twin Peaks police station; but throughout the series so far there’ve been more conventional signs that it’s taking place in the 2010s. The Double R Diner now touts its “RR2GO” service, for example; and at the Great Northern, Ben Horne is taken aback when he receives Agent Cooper’s old room key in the mail, because the hotel hasn’t used metal keys in years.Along those same lines, early in this week’s episode, Sarah Palmer is at the store buying the ingredients for what’s going to be a very potent pitcher of Bloody Marys when she gets thrown off by the assortment of fancy jerkies behind the counter. Meanwhile, behind her in the shot, there’s a sign advertising “Artisan Bread,” and a shelf containing Jim Beam’s high-end small batch bourbon Knob Creek.In other words: Sarah, who once upon a time was an upstanding housewife from one of the most prominent families in the quaint, resolutely American town of Twin Peaks, suddenly realizes that she’s living in a community that’s become fashionable, up-to-date and taken over by the young. And it freaks her out.That’s not the only thing bothering Sarah, of course. She has a long history of psychic disturbances, dating from the original run of “Twin Peaks.” Later, when Deputy Chief Hawk Hill stops by to check on her, Lynch makes sure to show the Palmer house’s ominous ceiling fan, which spoke menacingly to Laura Palmer in the movie “Fire Walk With Me.” And while Hawk’s at the doorstep, he hears an unexplained noise in the house that Sarah waves off as just “something in the kitchen.” Clearly, all is not well there.Still, part of what’s off is that the world is changing. And over and over, this episode sets the old against the new, while marveling at the contrasts.Sometimes Lynch and Frost do it for comic effect, as in one brief scene where Sonny Jim drags Dougie out to his Vegas backyard for an good ol’ game of catch, and promptly bounces the baseball off his fake-dad’s head. At other times, the references to the modern world are fraught with irony, like when Chantal and Gary Hutchens assassinate Warden Murphy and then announce their plans to go get some Wendy’s. And sometimes the show uses modernity for simple plot convenience, such as having Diane use her cellphone to enter coordinates that point her to Twin Peaks.Mostly, the episode strikes a wistful tone. The momentum that’s energized the show in recent weeks continues, as the plot keeps driving the characters to an inevitable reunion. But this hour also pauses to reflect and to call back to old legacies and traditions.For example, Gordon and Albert finally explain why they use the term “Blue Rose” for their more paranormally inclined cases, initiating Agent Preston into their secret society by telling her that the Blue Roses are connected to the canceled U.F.O. investigation “Project Blue Book.” Then they call in Diane — who emerges from a thick, reddish-hued curtain that looks unnervingly like the décor in the Black Lodge — and deputize her in the Blue Rose-worthy hunt for Agent Cooper, to which she growls, “Let’s rock,” just like the Man From Another Place did back on the original show.The most substantial return to the past though involves the Horne family. When Sheriff Truman delivers the news about the murderous Richard Horne to his grandfather Ben — prompting a mournful reverie about Ben’s old green Schwinn bicycle, and a lament that Richard grew up without a father — “Twin Peaks” devotees might’ve recalled for the first time in weeks that there’s been one key Horne conspicuously absent this season.And then — so unceremoniously that it takes a moment to register her presence — the missing Horne appears for the first time. Sherilyn Fenn, playing Audrey Horne, has an elliptical five-minute conversation with the character actor Clark Middleton, who plays her husband, Charlie. They talk about people we may or may not have met yet, named Tina and Paul; and throughout Audrey expresses her worry about the disappearance of the man she’s been sleeping with, “Billy” (who could be the recently supernaturally slain South Dakotan William Hastings, or could be someone else entirely).If there was important information in that scene, it was hard to register, because it’s just such a delight to get some sense of what Audrey’s been up to (even though she looked pretty unhappy). It’s not entirely fair to judge a work of art based on knowledge beyond what’s inside the frame, but surely Lynch and Frost were aware of how excited die-hard “Twin Peaks” fans would be to see Audrey again ... which is why they were able to bring her back in a scene that otherwise adds little to the plot.Similarly, the preponderance of actors on this show who died not long after the shoot keeps adding a poignancy to the proceedings, which the creators are clearly exploiting — and not cheaply. The other standout scene comes when Albert drops by Gordon’s room to fill him in on what Diane’s been texting. He catches his boss sharing a glass of his excellent Bordeaux with a French lady he apparently met down in the hotel bar. The unnamed date (amusingly played by Bérénice Marlohe) fusses with her dress’s hemline, her tiny sweater and her makeup compact, taking forever to leave the room. After she’s gone, Gordon tells a punny story about her, which Albert greets with his usual stone face.But then, in the midst of the two old friends’ exchange, there’s a long pause, and a gesture of quiet concern from Cole to Rosenfield. For a moment it doesn’t feel as if we’re watching two longtime “Twin Peaks” characters share a moment together. It feels more as if Lynch, the director, is expressing genuine compassion for the actor Miguel Ferrer, who had throat cancer during production, before ultimately dying in January of this year.Extra Doughnuts:• Speaking of dear old friends, many thanks to Scott Tobias — whom I’ve known for over 25 years now — for filling in for me last week while I was on vacation. I’ve nothing to add to his excellent review of a very good episode, except to note one detail Scott may have missed (given that he hasn’t been as immersed in “Twin Peaks” as I have over the past few months). The spot where Gordon and Albert find the body of Ruth Davenport — and where Bill Hastings gets his head squished into goo by a woodsman — has an address that includes the word “Sycamore.”That connects both to the haunting original song “Sycamore Trees” that Jimmy Scott sings in the original series finale, and to the circle of 12 sycamores in Glastonbury Grove that’s a portal to the Black Lodge. It seems that if you want to visit the dark other-world where mystical entities dwell, the first thing to do is look for sycamores. (There’s also a King Arthur connection to sycamore trees, which ties into this show’s fairly stealthy Arthurian motif… but that’s something to address later on this season, if it proves relevant.)• In “Fire Walk With Me,” Carl Rodd seems like a fairly cantankerous fellow, but here he’s been a total sweetheart, showing compassion for the residents of the town and the denizens of his trailer park. This week he gives his resident handyman a break on rent, because he’s heard the man is selling his blood to make ends meet. That’s a refreshing flash of kindness in a show where people are often cruel. (Also, not to be morbid, but watching this series populated by so many actors who’ve died, I have to keep reminding myself that Harry Dean Stanton’s still with us.)• Our musical guest at the Bang Bang Bar this week is Chromatics, singing a song called “Saturday.” More significant (perhaps), the roundhouse coda introduces yet another batch of previously unseen Twin Peaks residents, dealing with their own seemingly unrelated-to-the-main-plot personal relationship drama, again featuring people we’ve never heard of.It’s interesting that this scene comes so soon after Audrey’s testy conversation with Charlie, in which she also tosses out a bunch of names that may or may not matter to the story. It may be that all of these offscreen characters will come into play in the next few weeks. But given that we’re two-thirds of the way through the season, it’s more likely these new folks — all of whom are apparently in some kind of terrible trouble — are just meant to illustrate how the world these characters inhabit is deeply troubled."
591525a97c459f24986df20e,Sometimes It Is All Just Fun and Games,2017-05-12,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/business/stan-weston-gi-joe-barbie-frisbee-monopoly.html,The New York Times,"Toys can be mirrors of society, often invented in response to events and trends, sometimes created to divert attention from what may be happening at the time.The military action figure G.I. Joe, for example, came out of the Cold War, when patriotism was running high in the United States after victory in World War II and the rise of the Soviet Union. Its creator, Stan Weston, died last week.Here are some other classic toys and their mark on American culture.BarbieBarbie changed everything that toymakers thought they knew about children when she strutted into little girls’ hands in 1959.At 12 inches tall with a scantily clad, curvaceous body and stiltlike legs, she flew off shelves and quickly became a cultural flash point over body image.No longer were girls seeking out baby dolls; Barbie, a teenage fashion model, inspired them to imagine their grown-up lives. Besides wearing ball gowns and wedding dresses, she evolved to hold more than 100 occupations, complete with dozens of uniforms, outfits and accessories.“Barbie wasn’t so expensive; it was getting her all the clothes and houses and cars and accessories that built this whole business model in the 1960s,” said Chris Bensch, a curator at the Strong, a museum in Rochester dedicated to the history of toys and play. “Barbie fit with the consumer culture after World War II, as well as this huge demographic of baby boom kids, with parents who had solid enough jobs that they could buy nice gifts.”Cabbage Patch KidsThey were chubby-cheeked and chinless, but the dolls became wildly popular in the 1980s in part because of how they were made, with computers that generated random combinations of hard plastic heads with plush bodies. A wide range of skin tones, eye colors and hair types made each of the dolls unique. They even came with names, birth certificates and adoption papers. Of the three million Cabbage Patch Kids sold in 1984 alone, no two were alike, according to Toys and American Culture: An Encyclopedia.The production lines could hardly keep up with the demand, and shoppers were said to brawl over them in toy store parking lots.“Barbie represents the perfect golden Californian: No warts. No pimples. The kind of girl every kid perhaps would like to grow up to be,” Arnold Greenberg, the chief executive of Coleco, which manufactured the Cabbage Patch line, told The New York Times in 1985. But, he said, “Cabbage kids are all different.”“They are not perfect,” he said. “They represent you and me with all our warts. They are almost antihero.”The FrisbeeThe popular belief is that Frisbees — sometimes also called Flying Saucers — were created in the 1950s, after Americans became obsessed with accounts of U.F.O. sightings in Roswell, N.M. But flying discs were being tossed long before then — although they weren’t actually toys, but metal pie trays. As recounted by Toys and American Culture, students at Yale University would finish their treats from the nearby Frisbie Pie Company in New Haven and toss the empty dishes back and forth, shouting “Frisbie!” to warn bystanders.It was Walter Morrison, a former World War II military pilot, and his friend Warren Franscioni who improved the design and marketed the resulting disc as a toy. At first they tried to tap into the growing public fascination with extraterrestrials by giving the disc names like Pluto Platter. Eventually, though, they reverted to calling the toy simply Frisbee.Early on, to help business, Mr. Morrison and Mr. Franscioni demonstrated the toys’ aerodynamic capabilities on college campuses, but observers were skeptical, said Mr. Bensch, the toy museum curator.“They didn’t believe it could do the things it did, and thought it had to have an invisible wire,” he said. So the company offered the toy free but said the invisible wire would cost a dollar. Before long, there seemed to be one on every roof.The Hula HoopThe craze that first twirled its way into postwar American backyards in 1958 began when two toymakers, Spud Melin and Richard Knerr, learned of a bamboo hoop that children in Australia spun around their waists in gym class. Seizing on the idea, the two men enlisted the Phillips Petroleum company to create a colorful, pliable plastic version, and a gyrating phenomenon took hold, especially among California hipsters.In their first year, 40 million hoops were sold; by 1960, sales had reached 100 million. Contests were held to see who could keep the hoop spinning the longest; the record stands at 74 hours and 52 minutes.Etch A SketchInvented in France, where it was called L’Écran Magique, the drawing toy was a sensation when it was manufactured for the American market in 1960 by the Ohio Art Company. The toys were filled with an aluminum powder and plastic beads that clung to the inside of a screen. Two knobs allowed the user to control a stylus that would draw, or etch, lines — one knob horizontally, the other vertically — through the powder. Carefully turning the knobs simultaneously could produce curves, and some have created intricate works of art.“Its name in France was the Magic Screen, and that paralleled television,” Mr. Bensch said. “Televisions were in black and white; so was Etch A Sketch.”Twister“They said it was like selling sex in a box,” Mr. Bensch said.The game was originally marketed in 1966 for ages 6 and up, but Sears Roebuck wouldn’t list it in its catalog because the company thought the idea was too racy, according to Toys and Games.In the game, a spinner would dictate which limb would go on which enlarged colored dot on a large vinyl floor mat (“Right hand, yellow”; “Left foot, green”). A player who fell would be out of the game.Then one day Johnny Carson demonstrated it on “The Tonight Show” with a guest, the actress Eva Gabor. Millions of people saw them intertwined and giggling, and the game took off, with more than three million copies sold by 1967.Teachers of young children have even found a place for it in classrooms.“You don’t even have to know how to count,” Mr. Bensch said. “You just have to know the right foot from the left foot.”Monopoly The inspiration for Monopoly was called the Landlord’s Game, developed in 1904 by Elizabeth Magie Phillips to show how land-grabbing helped greedy property owners while impoverishing tenants, according to Toys and Games.The game that was later developed by Charles Darrow and bought by Parker Brothers ditched the moral lessons, and suddenly, bankrupting friends and family members became a favorite pastime in millions of households.For just $1, the game was a worthwhile investment during the Great Depression.“It was hours of occupation, fun and socializing that you could keep enjoying again and again,” Mr. Bensch said. “It’s a testimonial to the right thing at the right time.”"
58c15fe67c459f247962e223,Hari Kunzru: By the Book,2017-03-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/books/review/hari-kunzru-by-the-book.html,The New York Times,"The author, most recently, of “White Tears” says it might be nice to give Theresa May a book that shows England from an outsider’s perspective: She “strikes me as the kind of Tory who has read too much Trollope and not enough of anything else.”What books are currently on your night stand?An anthology of Pasolini’s writings called “In Danger”; “Journal of an Ordinary Grief,” by the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish; another anthology of recent political poetry and prose called “Anguish Language: Writing and Crisis”; and a proof of Margaret Jull Costa’s new translation of Pessoa’s “The Book of Disquiet,” which I’m particularly excited to read, as somehow I could never make headway with the older English translation and have hopes that at last this famous book will break open for me.What’s the last great book you read?Like a lot of people, I suspect, given the political situation, I’ve been rereading James Baldwin. I’m working through the Library of America edition of the collected essays. So I could say “The Fire Next Time.”What classic novel did you recently read for the first time?I spent the first half of last year living in Berlin, as a fellow at the American Academy. It was the perfect place to read Thomas Mann’s “The Magic Mountain.” I used to eat breakfast with the other fellows and secretly imagine we were all inmates in a sanatorium.What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of? I don’t know if it counts as particularly obscure, since it’s in print as a Penguin Classic, but I think more people should read Count Jan Potocki’s bizarre Gothic fantasy, “The Manuscript Found in Saragossa.” The vastly wealthy Polish traveler and dilettante wrote it in the years before his suicide in 1815, but it wasn’t published until much later. Set in Spain, it tells dozens of interlocking stories, involving kabbalists, bandits, shape-shifters, cannibal Gypsies, the Wandering Jew and an underground Muslim society. As in, literally underground, in mountain caves, driven into secrecy by the Reconquista.What moves you most in a work of literature?The feeling that the writer is putting him- or herself at risk, either by excavating something uncomfortable or embarrassing, or just by scrupulously trying to tell a difficult truth.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?As a teenager, for several years I read nothing but fantasy and science fiction. Later my tastes changed, and as a self-conscious young would-be literary writer I was embarrassed by my S-F days. Later I went back and began to read it again, rather gingerly, never with the same absorption or commitment as when it had colonized my entire imagination, but with pleasure. Recently I’ve enjoyed Ted Chiang’s “Stories of Your Life” and Charles Stross’s “Accelerando.”How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?Perhaps I’d own an e-reader if they didn’t track what you were doing. I find that an intolerable invasion of privacy, a red line. I read PDFs on an iPad, but otherwise it’s all paper, several books at a time. I am always surrounded by teetering ‘to-read’ piles. I have small children, so I get a fraction of the reading time I used to, mostly after they’ve gone to bed.How do you organize your books?What is acceptable New York Times style for conveying hollow cackling laughter?What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?I have a small collection of mystical U.F.O. and spiritualist ephemera, such as a series of pamphlet interviews with the ghosts of famous dead people (Rembrandt, Einstein, etc.) and a record of a conversation between Jesus and “an Earth person” which took place “hundreds of miles from Earth in the purple magnificence of star-studded Space” in 1959. I recently bought a lot of old nurse-romance paperbacks on eBay. I have no idea what I will do with nurse-romance paperbacks, but it seems like there might be some kind of tone or format that I could mine them for.What’s the best book you’ve ever received as a gift?My wife gave me a copy of the Japanese experimental director Shuji Terayama’s photo book “The People of the Dog-God Family.” The people are exquisite and surreal and perverse. It’s a beautiful object, and a hard book to find.If you could require the prime minister to read one book, what would it be? The American president?Theresa May strikes me as the kind of Tory who has read too much Trollope and not enough of anything else. It might be nice to give her a book that shows England from an outsider’s perspective, perhaps Sam Selvon’s “The Lonely Londoners.” Or something by Victor Serge, though that would just be trolling. I think the president might benefit from a basic civics textbook, something with large print.Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn’t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?I start a lot of contemporary novels and don’t finish them. Often I don’t get beyond the first couple of chapters. I used to force myself to finish everything I started, which I think is quite good discipline when you’re young, but once you’ve established your taste, and the penny drops that there are only a certain number of books you’ll get to read before you die, reading bad ones becomes almost nauseating.What do you plan to read next?Other than the things on my night stand? I’m writing something set in Berlin, and working hard, if frustratingly slowly, on my German. I’m going to read the East German dissident Jürgen Fuchs’s “Vernehmungsprotokolle” (“Interrogation Records”), accounts of his conversations with his interrogators while a detainee of the Stasi in Hohenschönhausen prison. I also have the poet Monica Youn’s collection “Blackacre,” which might be quite a good way to take my mind off German compound words about surveillance."

My father had purchased a small cabin on a lake in Minnesota, and needed a new well. He hired a drilling contractor, an old man who arrived blindfolded with a forked tree branch in hand. He was a dowser, and the branch was his divining rod. The blindfold was to help him concentrate on the vibrations of the branch. It quickly led him to a source of water. The divining rod pulled the dowser up the driveway, past the cabin, adroitly between trees and over the full length of our dock to its end, where he — sploosh! — fell into four feet of lake water. My father and I fished the blindfolded geezer from the lake and guided him to shore. After he had finished coughing and sputtering up water, my dad fired him.Annie Jacobsen, whose previous book was “The Pentagon’s Brain,” has written an entertaining narrative of the many salaried people in our government who have supported the exploration of psychic phenomena, but who all have displayed less wisdom than my father. Her new book, “Phenomena: The Secret History of the U.S. Government’s Investigations Into Extrasensory Perception and Psychokinesis,” chronicles the hilarious escapades of men and women who should have been promptly fired rather than immortalized by this skillful reporter.The usual disciplines are explored: ESP, clairvoyance, traveling clairvoyance (or out-of-body experiences), psychometry (divining information from objects), skin reading, dowsing, eyeless sight, mental telepathy, synthetic telepathy (using microwaves), outbounder-beaconry (don’t ask), mind projection, psychoenergetics, remote viewing, E.H.B.F. (extraordinary human body function), spoon bending, remote action, remote perturbation (a gentler version of the former), precognition, divination, automatic writing, cryptomnesia (unconsciously evoking latent memories) and premonition/intuition (a.k.a. “Spidey sense”).Devotees of the unseen world will be familiar with the cast of characters: Uri Geller, the spoon bender; Edgar Mitchell, the Apollo astronaut who did ESP experiments on his way to the moon; Cleve Backster, who gave polygraph tests to plants; Ingo Swann, a pioneer of remote viewing; Karlis Osis, an expert on deathbed visions; J. B. Rhine, of Duke University’s Parapsychology Laboratory; Jacques Vallée, the U.F.O. astronomer; Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ, of the weird Stanford Research Institute; Charles Tart, the altered states aficionado. They’re all here, a Who’s Who of the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night world for true believers to enjoy.Much of the information presented is already known, but Jacobsen has accomplished the gargantuan feat of bulldozing it all into one place, with additional details gleaned via searches under the Freedom of Information Act, followed up with recent interviews of sundry paranormalists involved. She has a keen eye for amusing anecdotes, and writes them up with convincing detail. More than that, Jacobsen has arranged her story in a kind of nonfiction picaresque novel. Her marginal real-life characters appear, disappear, then reappear episodically, wisely sticking to the shadows of the bureaucracy, often paid secretly, accomplishing nothing.Andrija Puharich is the pioneer of the book, the man who monetized and institutionalized psychic phenomenology. He worked his way through medical school as a tree surgeon, and came to the epiphany that the human nervous system works like the roots of a tree. (Note to reader: This is not true.) Puharich persuaded rich people, mostly heiresses, to spend the hard-earned (by others) money they had inherited on his Round Table Foundation, which studied ESP, telepathy and other psychic phenomena. The foundation conducted experiments in an opulent seaside mansion in Maine designed by Stanford White.Then Puharich found still deeper pockets, organizations even more willing to spend other people’s money: the United States military and intelligence services. Jacobsen describes the multidecades-long effort to lavish oodles of taxpayer funds on techniques that never worked.After Puharich, every psychic and crystal-ball reader piled on. The C.I.A., for example, funded efforts to produce a drug that would turn off ESP even before ESP itself was discovered. Our Army (“Be all you can be”) conducted classified experiments to detect ESP in cats. How the Army planned to weaponize ESP cats is not explained. When Uri Geller met Wernher von Braun, he used psychokinesis to bend the rocket scientist’s gold wedding band, then fixed his pocket calculator via mind control. Analysts in the Pentagon decided Geller could be used as an antiballistic missile system, altering the electrical circuits of incoming ICBMs. In the Pentagon’s words, imagining the utility of psychokinesis for this task “would not be conceptually difficult.”None of the experiments described in “Phenomena” struck me as scientific. The psychics were tested by other believers, as it was maintained that any negative attitudes would foil the experimental results. There was no legitimate peer review or efforts to replicate results. Management overseers — the people who got the money — were philosophically onboard. One of them, Maj. Gen. Albert Stubblebine, admitted that his goal in meditation was to learn how to levitate.What the psychic researchers were best at was finding success where none existed. When, in 1988, Marine Lieut. Col. William Richard Higgins was abducted in Lebanon by Hezbollah, one of our nation’s top remote viewers, Angela Dellafiora, was asked to find him by psychic means. She announced that he was still alive, being moved from place to place, and was “on water.” In fact, he was long dead. The terrorists had kept his body on ice to preserve it. Dellafiora’s supervisor declared success. After all, she had said he was “on water,” and ice is frozen water.Jacobsen does not come up with a dollar total for how much has been spent by the government on psychic phenomena, but the Stanford Research Institute, where some of this work was conducted, had a yearly budget of $70 million. Jacobsen’s admirable deadpan style made me first believe that her book is an exposé of government foolishness. In the final chapters, however, she appears sympathetic to the field.Kenneth Kress, a C.I.A. analyst, wrote that belief is a binary issue with regard to the paranormal. There are “two types of reactions… positive and negative, with little in between.” Jacobsen’s sources should have used mind control to get her a more receptive Times reviewer. I was a bust in catechism class, never getting behind the Jesus stuff. The miracle of feeding the 5,000 with five loaves and two fishes mystified me. With such powers, I would go, “Hey, filet mignon for everybody!” Same deal, Uri Geller. With mental metal-bending skills, why not form sheet metal panels for General Motors rather than ruin people’s silverware?In the late 1970s I constructed the editorial format for a science magazine called Omni. The owner asked me to include some coverage of paranormal science. During a 10-year period, looking for just one legitimate event, I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of this man’s money, not to mention suffering through tedious lunches with lunatics. (Have you ever tried eating crème brûlée with a bent spoon?) Then there were meetings with the psychics’ equally creepy codependents, the debunkers. Every psychic phenomenon our staff looked at was quickly discredited, or duplicated easily by magicians.“Phenomena” winds down as a picaresque novel should. It goes nowhere, and there is no character development. The people end up as shallow as they began. Jacobsen finds Geller filthy rich but still willing to bend spoons for people in restaurants. In 1995, suffering from dementia, kidney failure and gangrene in one leg, Andrija Puharich, surrounded by feral cats (sans ESP), fell down a flight of stairs to his death.Most sad, perhaps, is Edgar Mitchell, the ESP astronaut. He opens a safe for Jacobsen and extracts a bent spoon. Mitchell did not bend the spoon with his mind. He did not see it get bent. It was mailed to him by a woman who claimed it was bent by her son while watching Geller on television. He tells Jacobsen that the bent spoon inspires him.“Everyone has heroes,” Jacobsen writes. “Ed Mitchell is one of mine.”"
5769701938f0d80acef16e99,Jenny Holzer’s Unexpected New Canvas: The Boulders of Ibiza,2016-06-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/t-magazine/art/jenny-holzer-ibiza.html,The New York Times,"One wouldn’t normally imagine Jenny Holzer hanging around Ibiza — but the prolific, text-based artist made multiple trips there in the late ’90s, during and after installing a show in the Guggenheim Bilbao. “I fixed on the island although — or because — I was post-disco by the time I arrived,” she tells T in an email. “I studied stone cliffs, watchtowers and surf pebbles. I saw smiley nude and half-naked old people, babies and hotties. There was much to love.” She returned the following year after showing light projections on the Spanish Steps in Rome. Referring to herself, she says: “That time, this nerd looked at sea-cut rocks with holes, and caves.”Last year, the art collector Guy Laliberté asked her to fill up his Lune Rouge and Art Projects Ibiza spaces, in collaboration with Sprüth Magers, and to create a site-specific commission. “I was game,” Holzer says. “Musicians, writers and artists have touched down or wintered here because they found the island hospitable, or that corny word, ‘magical.’ Living was cheap, easy. And musicians, writers, artists come from Ibiza. The island’s pirate past, and the Carthaginian, Roman, Vandal, Moorish and Norwegian conquerors, to name a few, are fodder.” She also mentions the local contemporary art museum (“with Phoenician objects!”) and, of course, Laliberté’s contributions, as draws to the island.For “ARE YOU ALIVE?,” opening today, Holzer brought along some old friends — her signature “Truisms” and her LED scrolls (albeit with fresh phrases) — and fabricated a series of aphorism-etched footstools and benches. However, the highlights have to be the carefully chosen cliffs, boulders and bedrocks that became canvases for engraving. Situated about 15 miles from Laliberté’s outposts, some of the rocks are in the sightline of the small, uninhabited isle Es Vedrà, reportedly the third-most magnetic place on Earth after the North Pole and the Bermuda Triangle, and shrouded in legend. It’s “said to be the home of the Sirens, a protrusion from Atlantis, the material of pyramids and certainly the location of multiple U.F.O. sightings,” Holzer shares. As such, “much writing on the outdoor piece is by those who perfected absurdity, namely Apollinaire and Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.” She also selected lines of poetry in French, Spanish, Portuguese and English.Her debut exhibition in Ibiza came with “the same biggest challenge as always, not to be a crummy artist,” says Holzer, herself not one to mince words. “I let myself be sensitive when picking boulders and their text, and I might survive that. I could try ‘sensitive’ again.”"
5666560638f0d84cb15f71df,"‘Fargo’ Season 2, Episode 9: Going Undercover",2015-12-08,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/arts/television/fargo-season-2-episode-9-going-undercover.html,The New York Times,"A couple of weeks ago, FX gave the green light to a third season of “Fargo,” further extending an enterprise that was originally intended as a 10-episode limited series. Coincidentally or not, Monday’s episode introduced a misguided framing device (narrated by Martin Freeman, from the show’s first season) that casts the events of Season 2 as the bloody middle chapter in a much broader crime story.That story, a book titled “The History of True Crime in the Mid West,” chronicles events that “took place in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota from 1825 to the present,” it reads, which adds over 150 years and a couple of states to the territory the series has covered already. That’s good news for fans of the show, but a troubling sign of mission drift as well: Can “Fargo” keep opening up without losing its identity?But that’s a question for later. (Noah Hawley, the series creator, has been talking about the Midwestern true-crime book concept for a while, it should be noted.) The chapter I’d like to read after tonight’s episode is “The History of the U.F.O. in the Writer’s Room.” The U.F.O. subplot had its origins in the real story of Val Johnson, a Minnesota sheriff who had a close encounter while driving down a country road in 1979.“Fargo” has been teasing the U.F.O. all season long, from its appearance at the Waffle Hut in the first episode to the wooden sign at the convenience store Monday night in which Hanzee shot the clerk and peeled off in his Eldorado. From the beginning, I’d been concerned about grafting supernatural elements onto a show that’s essentially a crime thriller, however eccentric it likes to get. My faint hope was that it would remain a quirky accent on the season, no more consequential than the other ’70s bric-a-brac that’s been outfitting the show.Instead, the U.F.O. reveals itself as a giant deus ex machina, appearing just in time to help Lou Solverson to get the better of Bear Gerhardt. It seems highly unlikely that the writers introduced the U.F.O. subplot for the express purpose of getting Lou out of a jam during the season’s big shootout, but it certainly plays that way. Because what else has the subplot brought to “Fargo”? Between the U.F.O. and the framing device, “The Castle” was a prime — and unfortunately timed — example of the show’s weakness for being too clever by half. Mr. Hawley and his team have gotten more confident in both the plotting and the direction of “Fargo” this season, but all that swagger can spill over into excess. Sometimes less is more, even on a show this extravagantly stylized.We’re at a point in the season where there’s little left to learn about these characters, in part because so many of them have died off. But it’s a shame, after last week’s terrific episode, that the writers felt they needed to speculate openly in the narration about why Hanzee suddenly turned on the Gerhardts. As a rule, a work of art should never interpret itself, but it’s particularly galling for “Fargo” to unpack the mysteries of the Hanzee character one week after suggesting possible answers so thoughtfully. We all have our opinions about when Hanzee took a turn — I cited a scene at the bar, but you could reach back long before or to the moment when Dodd insulted him as “half-breed” at the cabin — and we might have formed some additional opinions about why Hanzee continues to pursue the Blumquists at the end of this episode. We don’t need a narrator to help.With those complaints out of the way, “The Castle” did deliver a humdinger of a shootout at the Motor Motel, as the South Dakota police turn a dangerous situation into a bloody debacle. Under the best of circumstances, Dodd Gerhardt would still be alive and Ed Blumquist might have miraculously engineered a peaceful exchange with Mike Milligan, who could then have the drop on the Gerhardt family and perhaps make good on his promise to take the heat off the Blumquists. But Dodd is dead, and the Keystone Kops are on the case. Lou sees through their terrible plan to put on a wire on Ed and get Milligan to incriminate himself, but they have the arrogance to ship him back to Minnesota for offering his opinion. (Given the politics on “Fargo” this season, it’s probably no accident that the architect of this boneheaded operation is named Captain Chaney.)The spectacle of multiple cruisers pulling into the Motor Motel in the middle of the day dooms the mission before it starts and hands Hanzee a golden opportunity to send the remaining Gerhardt crew into the wasp’s nest. The astonishing stupidity of the operation proves a durable running joke: cops “going undercover” by wearing the same white T-shirts and jeans, the self-appointed “observer” pointing out that an ice machine is busted, a guy confessing that he likes “pissing in the pool.” By the time the Gerhardt cavalry arrives — which catches the cops by surprise, because they’ve gone “radio silent” — they almost deserve what’s coming to them.“The Castle” increases a body count that’s been outrageously high all season, nearly to the point where the Gerhardts and the Kansas City syndicate have closed the case by wiping each other out. All the Gerhardts are gone now save for Charlie, who’s safely in jail, and Hanzee, who’s defected, but the death of Floyd Gerhardt deserves a special citation. The entire ensemble has been superb from top to bottom this season, but Jean Smart’s performance as Floyd is the standout. There’s ample evidence to suggest that Floyd wasn’t interested in carrying on the family business as her husband would have. She wanted to strike a deal with Kansas City, whereas Otto would have gone out guns-a-blazin’.She wanted to protect her children and grandchildren’s future while projecting the strength and resolve to fight if necessary. She was a woman trying to operate in a world of men but was ultimately crushed by their destructive impulses, starting with those of her own son. It may not be right to say that Floyd doesn’t deserve to die at the end of Hanzee’s blade — the family business isn’t dry cleaning, after all. But in the words of Clint Eastwood in “Unforgiven,” another tale of pitiless violence, “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”• “I say we use the lemons we got and use the juice to catch these big fish.” Captain Chaney may be inept, but he’s great at mixing metaphors.• More voice-over on Milligan’s playing a “dangerous game” in pursuing the Dodd Gerhardt exchange: “He sought to rout the Gerhardt family once and for all.” Was that unclear without the narration?• Nice detail in having Hank tell Captain Chaney about the occasionally virtues of defying top-down leadership. His lieutenant told Eisenhower to “go to hell” for his plan to send troops to the slaughter. “I send that man a card every Christmas because I can,” Hank says.• One great exchange in the flying saucer scene. Ed pauses from fleeing the motel to witness this incredible alien spectacle. Peggy, fully actualized: “It’s just a flying saucer, Ed. We gotta go.”"

Meanwhile, physicists are puzzling over how quickly the universe is expanding; it seems to be going faster than physics predicts it should, which could be a clue that our understanding of the universe is missing something. I don’t have any jokes here. I just think this stuff is awesome.Brian: Forty light years is pretty far away. I was hoping I could find another planet to live on for the next four to eight years. I guess I’ll have to settle for Vancouver.Farhad: Eh, Canada. O.K., things picked up in the tech industry this week. For the first time in a long time, there was some news that didn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump. Instead, it pretty much all had to do with Uber.But we’ll get to that in a bit. Here are some other things that happened.First, Apple announced that its huge new headquarters building in Cupertino, Calif., would be completed in April. This is the spaceship building that Steve Jobs unveiled to the Cupertino City Council in the summer of 2011, in his last public appearance before he died that fall. Apple has named the new campus Apple Park, and it has named the campus auditorium after Jobs. The building will house 12,000 employees. I bet more than a few of them will have roller-skate races around the huge circular hallways.Brian: Apple’s campus renovations are long overdue. Have you tried to find parking there recently? It’s a nightmare — the place is flooded with Teslas and Mustangs.Anyway, Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, has been talking about this new campus for years now. The way it’s shaped — kind of like a U.F.O. — is supposed to foster stronger collaboration between different departments across Apple, whereas historically the divisions (hardware, software, special projects, Apple Minivan or whatever the heck they’re doing, iOS, Mac, etc.) have been very siloed. Let’s see if that happens. (Maybe one day we’ll be able to plug the iPhone charging cable into the ports on the new MacBook Pros — what a concept.)Farhad: If it takes a $5 billion building to eliminate dongles, I’m all for it.So a shocking thing happened this week: A subsidiary of Facebook copied a feature from Snapchat.I’m sorry, I should be above easy sarcasm as a joke. But this week the president used “NOT!” in a tweet, and it took me back to the fourth grade. Remember when people used to say, “Psych?”Brian: Tcha. I mean, totes.Farhad: Anyway, WhatsApp, which Facebook purchased for more than $19 billion a few years ago, rolled out a number of features this week that borrow heavily from Snapchat. This follows another Facebook-owned app, Instagram, rolling out Stories, a way to make collections of short videos that Snapchat also pioneered.I have no problem with this; as I’ve argued repeatedly, I think it’s generally good for consumers and innovation online when companies freely copy each other’s best software ideas. Still, it’s got to be just a little bit embarrassing for Facebook, which has been at the forefront of the social game for so long, to have completely run out of original ideas.As a columnist, I know that feeling well.Brian: Tell me about it. I just did my third advice column on phone plans in the last two years.Anyway, I’m used to social media giants cloning each other’s features, but I don’t think WhatsApp should have gone in this direction.People loved WhatsApp partly because it is a zero-nonsense, intuitive chatting app. So now WhatsApp’s new feature, called Status, basically lets people share images, GIFs or videos before they self-destruct in 24 hours. But do you know anyone who uses WhatsApp and desires features like these?I mostly see people using WhatsApp to keep in touch with others overseas. I’m not sure this will stick with consumers or help Facebook lure people away from Snapchat. All it does is add a layer of complexity to what was otherwise a perfectly solid messaging app that everyone knew how to use.Farhad: WhatsApp is great because it just works without any fuss. This all feels like a big fuss.Now let’s talk Uber. What a cluster. So, last weekend, a former Uber engineer named Susan Fowler published a lengthy blog post in which she went into lots of detail about sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber. She described a culture in which women were treated terribly and the human resources department did nothing.Then Mike, our Uber beat writer, published a really good piece detailing a whole bunch of other explosive stories about the company’s unrestrained culture. Then on Thursday, another shoe dropped: Waymo, a unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, filed suit against Uber. Waymo said that a former member of Google’s self-driving car project stole thousands of technical documents about the project before starting Otto, his own company — which Uber bought last year. And all this follows another controversy at Uber — C.E.O. Travis Kalanick’s one-time plan to join a presidential advisory council, which led to an outcry from employees and customers.Uber has pledged an investigation on the sexism charges, but it’s not at all clear that will be enough to quell the mounting anger against the company both internally and externally.So, where do you think this goes next?Brian: As these things often tend to go, Uber is going to be in damage-control mode for the coming months. It will probably release the results of the investigation and announce a mandatory sexual harassment training program for its employees.Mike’s reporting on this fiasco was truly stunning, and Uber’s response — “We are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone” — is remarkable in that there is no denial or justification whatsoever of the aggressive, chauvinistic work culture. Their next step, PR-wise, is to show the steps they are taking to “heal.”Farhad: I think that was the plan, but the script is already falling apart. Two of Uber’s early investors, Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein, published an open letter to Kalanick expressing their disappointment in how Uber has handled the crisis so far. The company has tasked Eric Holder, the former attorney general under President Obama, to lead an investigation into its culture. But the investors — who have long fought for better representation of women in tech companies — say that such an investigation will not be truly independent.“To us, this decision is yet another example of Uber’s continued unwillingness to be open, transparent and direct,” they said.This is something new in tech — you don’t ordinarily see investors calling out their companies. So it seems like Uber is going to have to do something much bigger and less superficial here…. I think.Brian: What an epic disaster. I guess Travis will have to make his employees do more than a few trust falls before they recover from this one.Farhad: This is one of those sagas that might never end. Well, thanks for being Mike this week, Brian.Brian: No problem. Did I sound childish enough? Smell ya later."
57363e9738f0d81c1d2c8e10,Why We Keep Dreaming of Little Green Men,2016-05-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/opinion/sunday/why-we-keep-dreaming-of-little-green-men.html,The New York Times,"CONSPIRACY theorists tend to cluster at the right and left of the political spectrum, so perhaps Hillary Clinton will attract at least a few voters from both the Trump and Sanders camps with her recent pledge to release documents about Area 51, the top secret military base in Nevada.Some of her critics have been dubious, suspecting that her vow, made on forums like Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talk show, was intended to distract attention from her emails and Goldman Sachs speeches. But among the electorate, the antennas of some U.F.O. seekers must have perked up — polls have found that more than a third of Americans are believers — when they heard a presidential candidate actually talking about Area 51.Suspecting that deep secrets are hidden there — in the form of captured aliens (dead or alive), crashed extraterrestrial spaceships and futuristic weaponry — U.F.O. die-hards have long pushed the government to come clean about the facility, which was established in 1955 as an annex of the Atomic Energy Commission’s Nevada Test Site. The official story — that Area 51 has been used for secret activities like testing the prototype of the U-2 spy plane and other experimental aircraft — seems to them like a cover-up, a suspicion fed by the government’s refusal to acknowledge the place’s existence until the release of a classified report in 2013.There was no mention of extraterrestrials, of course. What else are our leaders, who may be aliens themselves, going to say?The number of people fixated on Area 51 to the exclusion of other issues is probably not enough to swing more than a precinct here and there. But the fascination with alien cover-ups taps into a deeper vein. Maybe it’s different for the 0.1 percent at the top of the pyramid (you with your shining eye on the back of the dollar bill), but for most of us the world is a confusing, complicated, mind-numbing place over which we feel a dismaying lack of control.Sometimes one suspects that a piece of the puzzle must be missing, or dangling cruelly beyond our reach. You can either muddle along without it, as most of us try to do, or put your mind into hyperdrive, making connection after connection and piecing together a hidden order — a conspiracy so immense that it threatens to be more convoluted and complex than what it seeks to explain.The truth is out there or in there. Open the gates to the inner sanctum — whether it’s the Vatican, the Federal Reserve, the Masonic lodges or Area 51 — and suddenly everything will make sense.Masters of the craft (there is no good word, at least in English, for conspiracy theorizing) could be found in the 18th century, busily writing tracts and tomes concluding that the French Revolution was plotted by Freemasons working with the Bavarian Illuminati. The hypothesis quickly grew to include the Rosicrucians, the Knights Templar, the Cathars and ancient Egyptian religious cults — ingredients that Dan Brown made lucrative use of in “The Da Vinci Code.” All were said to be players in a secret world history that had been unfolding backstage for centuries, while the masses were distracted like children with shadow plays.From Europe this spider web of memes spread to the United States, where the existence of Masonic lodges led to suspicions of an Illuminati plot to surrender the country to France, a land teeming with Enlightenment philosophers with godless beliefs and cosmopolitan ways — the original secular humanists.Protected in its cocoon, this style of thinking — the “paranoid style,” the historian Richard Hofstadter memorably called it — was carried intact into modern times, with the nexus of evil moving to the Soviet Union, the Trilateral Commission and other suspected agents of One World Government. The next step was surely surrender to the Galactic Empire. No wall — it would have to be a planetary shell — could stop the ultimate aliens. “The Day the Earth Stood Still” was both a warning and a diversion. No wonder there are strange lights in the sky.So go the enduring themes in the literature of paranoia. From early on, the world’s secret rulers were said to possess extraordinary powers, supernatural and quasi-scientific. In the 18th century these included mesmerism, which later gave way to telepathy and then mind control through cellphone waves and chemtrails, spewed by aircraft launched, perhaps, from Area 51.President Obama’s real birth certificate may be there along with a new cache of climategate emails and the refrigerated room where John F. Kennedy is kept alive, hooked to electrodes, robotically enhanced and ready to take charge someday as the bionic president.It’s easy to get carried away, your reptilian brain fueling your cybernetic cerebrum, as click, click, click, you feel the pieces snapping together. The followers of Lyndon LaRouche, the world-class conspiracy theorist who runs periodically for president, propound a cracked and erudite worldview that has included conspirators like Aristotle, John Maynard Keynes, Werner Heisenberg and Timothy Leary — all linked through an internal logic that makes, for its believers, a scary kind of sense.It takes great mental powers to construct these intricacies no matter how crazy they are. Conspiracy theorists are not stupid people. Given a different turn in life, some might have made good superstring theorists.“The higher paranoid scholarship is nothing if not coherent,” Hofstadter wrote in “The Paranoid Style in American Politics.” “In fact the paranoid mind is far more coherent than the real world.”Other scholars have found that adherents of one conspiracy theory are likely to believe in others. They are good — maybe too good — at making connections. Maybe the phenomenon is neurological, with synapses packed so densely that the brain is driven to see way more order than can possibly be there.There are, of course, sensible reasons to believe in extraterrestrial life. Just last week, evidence for more than 1,200 new planets was reported. A fraction of those may harbor life, and a fraction of a fraction may have produced intelligent creatures. Exploring the universe, some may have caught sight of Earth and even landed. But probably not.If Mrs. Clinton is serious and releases files on Area 51 — those, she adds, that do not breach the country’s security — the result will probably be anticlimactic. More fuel for the conspiracy theorists."
587951ce7c459f2525d16811,"Meet Julio Torres, the New ‘S.N.L.’ Star No One Sees",2017-01-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/arts/television/meet-julio-torres-the-new-snl-star-no-one-sees.html,The New York Times,"At a sleepy show last month in the grim basement of the Broadway Comedy Club, a Midtown spot that feels frozen in time from the 1980s comedy boom, Julio Torres looked at his feet, speaking to a small crowd in a near monotone. “The hardest part about being vegan is the apologies,” he said, to silence. “People ask if I miss meat or dairy. I miss being liked.”Mr. Torres, a millennial comic with a slight build, shy persona and a hint of an accent (he emigrated from El Salvador), is better known in alternative spaces than in clubs, but this line got a big laugh. He raised his dyed- blond head and made eye contact before going for the kill: “I don’t miss cheese. I miss being asked to do things. I miss my friends and family.”Judging by the less-than-glamorous surroundings, you would never know that Mr. Torres is the newest star of “Saturday Night Live.” He has never appeared on the show, but if you’ve been surprised by incongruously dreamy comedy this season, chances are he had something to do with it.Mr. Torres, who has the same delightfully alien sensibility as his sometimes nickname, Space Prince, joined the writing staff in the fall and has already introduced a new style to the show, which returns on Saturday after a holiday break. Early in his tenure, he wrote a distinctively moody digital short, half in Spanish, starring Lin-Manuel Miranda as a sensitive boy named Diego calling his mother in Mexico from a telephone booth in a North Dakota cornfield, describing America with wonder and romance. (He explains a marshmallow salad with the baffled awe of someone seeing a U.F.O.) This monologue played as flashbacks of chain-store signs and football players took nostalgic tropes of Americana and repurposed them into an immigrant’s love letter. There were slight homoerotic overtones but not a note of gay panic.Mr. Torres, with Anna Drezen, also wrote a “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” satire the next week that imagined the sparring partners of that 1962 drama as hamsters trapped in a glass box. One week later, he returned to highbrow animals in a digital short, released online, that imagined what a swan inside a motel painting would say if he could talk. Turns out, he would harass the duck nearby. “Have you inspired countless ballets?” said the swan, voiced by Dave Chappelle. “What was it called?” he asked, adding, “It wasn’t called Duck Lake.”This rarefied comedy stands out on a laugh-hungry show that has long had a populist voice, leaning toward topical jokes, and broadly accessible references. But Mr. Torres’s approach is also not entirely successful, often more interesting than funny. Then again, he was just getting started. Much of his comedy on “Saturday Night Live” hinges on empathetic shifts in perspective, showing us the roiling inner life of an animal, an object (as in a hard-boiled sketch from the point of view of a  sink having an existential crisis) or a person not known for introspection.His first real triumph was another surprising immigrant story: “Melania’s Moments,” a series of digital shorts that detailed the thoughts of the future first lady in a concise form that resembles the mellow one-liners from the “S.N.L.” writer Jack Handey’s “Deep Thoughts.” Mr. Handey aimed for pure absurdity, but Mr. Torres makes Melania Trump a tragic, self-aware heroine trapped in her gilded cage.Approaching a window in Trump Tower, like a cursed princess, she gazes onto Fifth Avenue, wondering about Sixth Avenue the way a Chekhov character dreams of Moscow. In another short, she wakes up in a cold sweat with the sense that her replacement is being born in rural Latvia, then decides to protect her.Even though the writing staffs of “Saturday Night Live” have been as rich in talent as the casts, the star system has always worked only for those on camera. Performers became famous, while writers, even those like James Downey, who defined political humor for a generation, toiled in relative obscurity, partly because the show never revealed who was responsible for which sketch. (Mr. Handey was an exception.) But this has been changing. The stand-up John Mulaney has gained more than a little acclaim for writing jokes for the popular character Stefon, played by Bill Hader (who has given him credit in interviews).Comedy journalism online now covers writers’ rooms obsessively, and social media has also made the artistic process more transparent — with comics praising specific sketches.Die-hard New York comedy fans were already familiar with Mr. Torres (who appeared on Louis C.K.’s “Horace and Pete”) when he got the job. But he didn’t emerge from the usual clubs or improv factories. The buzz over his work grew in December, when he wrote two superb bits with Jeremy Beiler, digital shorts that earned laughs as much as knowing nods. Their sly ad for a new Fisher-Price toy for sensitive, lonely boys, “Wells for Boys,” uses a classic “S.N.L.” format — the ad satire — for an arch idea, that the delicate child’s version of a monster truck is a plastic well to sit near and brood.But Mr. Torres and Mr. Beiler delivered an even more impressive feat with the formally clever, but also topical, companion to “Melania’s Moments” that was presented from the point of view of Donald J. Trump. We now spend so much time looking at Mr. Trump that putting us behind his eyes was a fertile concept.This short has a paranoid vibe out of “Rosemary’s Baby,” but, like all of Mr. Torres’s sketches, it has a tone that’s sneakily sympathetic. Mr. Trump (played by John Cena) doesn’t appear to be having any more fun than his wife does in “Melania’s Moments.” Television blares insults about him. His handlers work him over, and his voters and colleagues bore him with tedium about politics and policy.Then comes relief (and the punch line) in the form of Kellyanne Conway, played by Kate McKinnon, who hypnotically encourages him to sleep. Mr. Trump dreams of a version of himself embracing him and declaring his love. Then the two Donald Trumps twirl together.This danse macabre is a study in self-obsession, but it also proposes an idea that is not only characteristic of Mr. Torres’s work, but also helps explain how he has successfully translated his idiosyncratic vision for a broad audience: Never underestimate people’s capacity to see themselves as outsiders, because, in our own minds, we all at some point see ourselves a bit as space princes."
5882de887c459f2525d17d4d,"For Baseball’s Hall of Fame, Do Statistics Alone Still Matter?",2017-01-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/opinion/for-baseballs-hall-of-fame-do-statistics-alone-still-matter.html,The New York Times,"It’s a line we’ve all heard, and have probably said to our kids. It starts with “there will always be someone” and concludes with a word like “faster” or “stronger” or “prettier” or “smarter.” It’s supposed to insulate our silver-lined dream clouds with the spray foam of pragmatism. It tells us that we cannot win them all, not just because of the statistical gods, but because of the gods of creation. Some people were simply born with more talent, and they are apparently all over the earth. Humility is the lesson.The Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2017 inductees were announced Wednesday, and it reminded me of something I quickly learned in the major leagues: Not only is that adage still true, but that when you distill talent into distinct categories, you’ll find that the universe is crawling with people who are quantifiably superior to you.Let’s look, first, at the players who will be inducted.Jeff Bagwell was a quiet revolution in his own right. Compact, with huge power, but also fantastic in an all-around sense. A power hitter who stole bases, a first baseman who, before his shoulder started barking, could throw out runners trying to sneak from second to third. Steady, talented, versatile and dangerous. Oh, and just plain fun to watch.Tim Raines’s career was winding down by the middle of mine, so my observations of his best days were from the fan perspective — Shea Stadium, Expos-Mets. There I witnessed a microcosm of his years of pure domination as the ideal offensive catalyst (and a switch-hitter on top of that). He had a career of sheer consistency, and the metrics developed in the last few years help us frame the deeper value of his statistics. He was on base all the time, and while on base, he was stealing the next one at will. For six seasons in a row, he stole over 70 bases. He rarely struck out. Contact, speed, defense, bat control.The catcher Ivan Rodriguez, known as Pudge, was exceptional on both offense and defense. He hit for average and power to all fields. But he was equally known for his amazing arm. I tested it twice playing against him in winter ball in his native Puerto Rico. Once was in the All-Star game, when I was trying to steal third. The third baseman had the ball before I even started thinking about sliding. And once during the regular season, after I got a great jump in stealing second, I became aware of this fast-moving U.F.O. coming in that never got more than a few feet off the ground. It was as if, for my last few steps, I was running backward.But I also marvel at the greatness of some of the players who have not gotten in … yet.Vladimir Guerrero, for example. When you play against someone who convinces you that there are more than one of him on the field, he must be special. On defense, his long strides and powerful arm made you worry that if he unleashed a wild throw he might hit you while running the bases. On offense, he made another great player, my teammate Scott Rolen, concede, “He is so much better than I am, it is ridiculous.” One time he hit a ball so hard near our shortstop’s head that the ball was by him before he reacted. As it skipped to the wall at a blistering speed, I still hadn’t even taken my first step toward it from center field. Our shortstop aged 20 years on that play. And despite Guerrero’s free-swinging nature (he once got a hit off a pitch that bounced on its way to the plate), he was very difficult to strike out.Trevor Hoffman pitched for the San Diego Padres as their closer for most of his career. Closers typically do not get much love from the Hall of Fame because for a long time they were seen as failed starters. That culture shifted permanently with Mariano Rivera and with Hoffman, who was known for his incredible, time-space-defying changeup. This year, I tweeted that the changeup he threw me in 1998 had just crossed home plate.Edgar Martinez spent much of his career as a designated hitter, a tough job to stay ready for because you sit for innings at a time. He mastered the technique of hitting “inside-out” — taking a pitch that you would normally hit, say, to the left side of the field and carving it to the right. This made him unpredictable and forced your defense to spread out more, which created safe havens for his line drives. He could hit foul line to foul line, prompting my old teammate Mark Grace to warn our pitcher during a spring training game: “Save yourself a pitch. Just throw the ball down the right-field line.”These players, and many others, I expect to be in the Hall of Fame within the next few years. They certainly were examples of the players who left an indelible mark in my memory simply by how much they stood out from among their competition.I had a respectable major league résumé. I may not have evoked Hall of Fame numbers, but I certainly had a few days in the sun. But I understood early in my career that, in spite of my high school and college legacy as a middle-of-the-order hitter, I was going to have to be a top defender, good decision maker and speed guy — at the top or bottom of the order — if I was going to survive in the big leagues for more than a moment. I didn’t worry too much that someone might have bigger numbers. Your true value came through how you used, understood and sharpened the tools in your toolbox.Maybe that is why our obsession with (and debate over) baseball statistics is timeless and also endless. I saw the pitfalls of putting heavy emphasis only on what you can compile. You risk overlooking players whose contributions cannot be quantified. Also, the distortion caused by the era of performance-enhancing drugs morphed what were once gold-standard metrics into something irreconcilable. We can no longer draw a hard line as a milestone of greatness — 500 home runs, 300 wins and so on. The once-dependable math got fuzzy.The opportunity here is that we can now look for meaning within these numbers, and not just count — even if this embroils the debate over difficult-to-define terms like “character” as requirements for Hall of Fame entry. This is a healthy direction to go, given that what stays in our souls from watching these players over time is a feeling, a moment, a memory that is often independent of math, even when we can recite the stat line of that player’s career. The scouting report fades, the lefty-righty splits are irrelevant, the weakness to his backhand side unimportant. Greatness is now the summation of your work.These players separate themselves from the pack through consistent excellence and longevity: the hallmark of a Hall of Famer.One of baseball’s challenges in the next decade of Hall of Fame voting will be to face the demons of the steroid era, the idea that some of this greatness we celebrate may have been purchased or artificially enhanced. It will make us wonder what defines the “better” that our parents were always talking about.So maybe “better” needs an asterisk, like the one suggested to frame the steroid era: one that notes that it is hard to learn humility by taking shortcuts to greatness. We will never know the full story of anyone who played in the steroid era, what they did or did not do, and that makes it unfair to indict an entire generation of baseball players. But at least we can challenge our kids not to trust their eyes — and to look deeper, beyond the numbers, for meaning."

59cac80e7c459f246b62b1b8,Pot Farmer to Neighbors: Chill Out. Neighbors: No.,2017-09-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/style/oregon-weed-farmers.html,The New York Times,"McMinnville, Ore. — “This is hostile territory. Everyone hates us.”I was riding up a steep hill near Highway 18 one August afternoon when Richard Wagner blurted out what his lawyer had told me weeks earlier: No one wanted to be his neighbor.Mr. Wagner, 33, was seated next to his mother, Mary, who was behind the wheel of her Subaru Outback, navigating a strip of dry grass and rocks in a meadow here overlooking the Willamette Valley. Mr. Wagner’s neighbors had made it possible last year for his parents to buy 6.7 acres of land. But in February, when he told them he was going to grow and process marijuana, his quaint country fellows suddenly weren’t so chill.He was sued. The neighbors also asked for a temporary restraining order to stop him from using a shared road to haul his products to market. When Mr. Wagner made a case for his processing facility at a county commission meeting in April, he was outnumbered by critics: 14 to one. Even Mother Nature turned a cold shoulder. A storm walloped his hilltop home with a foot of snow in January, one of the worst storms since the 1940s.Mr. Wagner, though, saved his particular ire for the winemaker who works at the bottom of the hill and who he said was his most powerful foe. “We don’t talk,” he said.In April, the winery owner filed a report with the sheriff’s office after the tail of one his cows was severed, warning it could be retaliation for opposing Mr. Wagner’s cannabis farm. Worse, the winemaker got threatening phone calls, one from a man who said he would torch the winery if he didn’t make peace with his ganja-loving neighbor.Now, no one wants to talk to Mr. Wagner. One resident simply scowls when he drives by. “He just stares at me, like he is trying to make me disappear,” he said.Many farmers see gold in today’s green rush, where a pound of high-grade marijuana can fetch the same price as a ton of grapes. But as pot farming has moved out of the forest and into the open field, neighborly relations are withering under the harshest light.Residents near Wenatchee, Wash., complained last year that the stink from a marijuana operation was so bad that they couldn’t barbecue outside. The county of San Luis Obispo, Calif., sued to stop pot growers who depleted the natural water supply, left trash and dangerous chemicals, and toppled portable toilets in their wake.And in Colorado, a federal appeals court ruled that a horse farm could sue a pot grower whose warehouse, it said, emitted not only noxious odors, but also attracted ne’er-do-wells. Marijuana businesses are flush with cash and product: Last year thieves in Oregon made off with 240 pounds of cannabis worth about $500,000.In Oregon, where recreational marijuana has been legal for two years, commercial growing is approved with a permit. But towns and counties — let alone people who live in rural areas and on farms — are only beginning to learn what it means to greet the pot farmer next door. Rick Olson, the former mayor of McMinnville and one of the commissioners who reviewed the Wagner case, said feuds like these are likely to multiply. Especially so in states including California and Arizona where the marijuana business is booming.“This isn’t going away,” he said.In 1997, Moe Momtazi bought an abandoned wheat farm in this bucolic corner of the Willamette Valley, where he planted grapevines and took a holistic approach to farming. He brews tea from stinging nettle and sprays it on foliage to ward off disease. He eschews pesticides and embraces mystical alchemy.On a tree outside his tasting room, a swollen deer bladder stuffed with yarrow blossoms once hung. Mr. Momtazi, 66, left it there to absorb celestial energy until it was buried on the autumnal equinox on his 532-acre estate.The Maysara Winery is a peaceful haven for Mr. Momtazi, who fled post-Revolution Tehran on the back of a motorcycle in 1982 with his wife, Flora, then eight months pregnant. They slipped over the mountains into Pakistan, he said, paying informants who threatened to report them to the police. He sometimes sits by the reservoir he built on his land, a reminder of a childhood spent at his family’s farm near the Caspian Sea.So it was with melancholy mixed with anger that Mr. Momtazi gestured up the hill one Thursday in August and pointed at Mr. Wagner, who was tending to his plants. They hadn’t spoken in six months, Mr. Momtazi said, and when they did, the vintner said he hung up the phone in frustration. “This is all very unfortunate,” he said, shaking his head.Mr. Wagner has a sinewy skateboarder’s body and was dressed in a gray T-shirt and loosefitting tan shorts when we met the next day on the deck of his house overlooking Mr. Momtazi’s vineyard. For roughly two years he and his parents, Mary and Steven, sought land so he could start growing and processing marijuana. As a younger man, Richard dabbled with growing pot in the Oregon forest, he said. He studied horticulture and landscaping in junior college. And he liked to make hashish.“I’m a good grower,” Mr. Wagner said. “But I’m a great processor.”Last year, the Wagners acquired the 6.7-acre lot for $682,000 at the end of Dusty Drive after months of negotiations over property adjustments involving the seller and his new neighbors. The land included an 8,000-square-foot barn big enough to cure and dry marijuana buds, as well as room to process extracts, rosins and hash. Then, too, the Yamhill County planning director approved Mr. Wagner’s processing facility, contingent upon his building a 32,000-gallon water tank.“That’s awesome, right?” said Mr. Wagner, adding, “Just doing what I love.”It is here, perhaps, Mr. Wagner made a critical misstep. Mr. Momtazi said neither he, nor his neighbors, were told about plans for the pot farm despite months of pre-sale property negotiations. Worse, when Mr. Momtazi later asked one of the real estate brokers about the farm, he said he was told it was a hushed affair. Mr. Wagner said the timing was irrelevant. “They would have fought it anyway,” he says now.In late February Mr. Wagner sent postcards to his neighbors with the name “Yamhill Naturals,” printed in white script. “I am your new neighbor at the end of the road,” he cheerily scrawled on the back of each card. He left his phone number and email address. “I also would like to discuss my plans for my new farming venture,” he wrote.The first neighbors he met were Glenda and Van Keck, organic farmers who have lived on Dusty Drive since 1974. “They were worried about the cannabis growing right from the get go,” Mr. Wagner said. “And I came over in hopes of quelling their concerns, to introduce myself, and to show them my plans.”At the time, he wanted to cultivate half an acre of organically grown marijuana, or about 1,000 pounds per year. He told the Kecks he would process in the barn using ice and water, a nonchemical method. Mr. Keck grumbled about his property values, Mr. Wagner said. Glenda Keck was largely silent. “She became very uncomfortable pretty quickly, and she left to go to Costco.” The Kecks did not return phone calls seeking comment.Parvathy Mahesh said she and her husband, Harihara, were told an older couple was moving in, not a pot farmer. She worried about trucks rumbling past her front yard, close to Mr. Wagner’s gate. And the road was too steep to sustain commercial traffic, she said. “If it was on a private road, that would be one thing,” Ms. Mahesh said. “But this road is shared by all the residents.”In early March, the Maheshes called the Kecks. Then they went to talk to Mr. Momtazi at his tasting room. “I said, ‘I don’t know anything about this,’” Mr. Momtazi said.He recalled that he and Mr. Wagner talked weeks earlier. His new neighbor mostly complimented him on his biodynamic farming practices, he said, and failed to mention marijuana. Mr. Wagner said he was hesitant to mention his farm, but did address the topic.The visit from the Maheshes sent Mr. Momtazi reeling. He wasn’t opposed to marijuana use, but a processing operation was something altogether different. His daughter, Hanna, who oversees events, scoured the internet and found Mr. Wagner’s Instagram account. On Jan. 14, he posted a photograph of the barn, a wall of storm clouds on the horizon.“The future sight of greenhouses, and processing facility,” Mr. Wagner wrote. “Watch for the build out coming soon!”Twelve days later, he posted another photograph, this time a selfie, his scruffy brown hair tucked under a baseball cap. “When I’m out on my land, my eyes stay glowing, and I still pinch myself occasionally just to make sure this is real!” he wrote. The posts stretched back to October 2016, about the same time the previous owners were negotiating with the neighbors to make it possible for the Wagners to buy the land.“He was planning this all along,” Hanna Momtazi said.Mr. Momtazi and the Maheshes researched the marijuana industry. The more they learned, the more nervous they became. State regulations required the Wagners to install cameras near gates and fences, along with motion sensors and alarms. There was the problem of the shared steep road.And, despite telling the Kecks he would not use chemicals, Mr. Wagner, in his initial business application, stated he wanted to use solvents, which are highly flammable. This gave his neighbors pause. Many explosions at illicit butane hash oil labs, for example, have been reported in Oregon, leading to fire and death.When asked about it, Mr. Wagner said he did not intend to mislead his neighbors. But by then, the relationships had soured. An attempt at détente failed. Mr. Wagner said he got into a shouting match with Mr. Momtazi over the phone. “We had very little trust,” Ms. Mahesh said. So, when the county commissioners agreed to hold a hearing in April regarding Mr. Wagner’s processing facility, the neighbors showed up in force.At 10:49 a.m. on April 13, Mr. Wagner and a dozen of his neighbors and their supporters met face to face in Room 32 in the county courthouse in downtown McMinnville. Mr. Wagner spoke first, outlining his organic farming and processing practices and why he believed he would have no negative impact on the environment.A pile of grievances followed. Mr. Momtazi warned that the marijuana operation would produce “foul-smelling particles” that could change the flavor of his grapes. He worried, too, that the reservoir he built might get contaminated if Mr. Wagner used pesticides or solvents.The Maheshes complained about the condition of the road and a lack of privacy once Mr. Wagner’s cameras went up. And the Kecks said the value of their land would plummet next door to a pot farm. Ms. Keck even mentioned that the smell of marijuana set off her migraines.After an hour and a half, Mr. Wagner and his opponents were spent. “I thought I was going to blackout, I was so mad,” he said. He ended the hearing, telling the commissioners that Yamhill County farmers were once afraid of wineries. But now they were “the lifeblood” of the Willamette Valley.Three days after the hearing, the Maneshes and Mr. Momtazi petitioned a judge for a temporary restraining order against Mr. Wagner. The petition was denied.On April 19, The Oregonian published an article about the feud. More than 500 people posted comments online, most in support of Mr. Wagner. Within days, Mr. Momtazi started getting threatening phone calls.‘We are going to burn the building,” he recalled one person saying on his answering machine.“They said that?” asked his wife, Flora, who was visiting the winery.“Yeah, we didn’t tell you that,” he said. “It was really scary. They said, ‘We are going to kill you. We are going to burn the building.’ And that is when we called the sheriff and we found out one of the calves was mysteriously dead. The tail of one of the cows was cut in half.” His wife stared, dumbfounded. “She kept telling us,” Mr. Momtazi said of his wife, “‘You need to be careful.’”Hanna, Mr. Momtazi’s daughter, retrieved her cellphone. “Ganja rules, man!” one caller shouted. Another left his phone number. She played the recording. “What’s wrong with you,” the man said, his message peppered with foul language. “Try to live peaceably among your neighbors.”The man was Richard Colvin, 53, a Portland resident who said in an interview he heard about the story from local news. When asked, though, he could not recall what the dispute was about. He blamed the media. “The way it sounded to us it was a bunch of people whining about a marijuana grower,” he said. “Maybe I was feeling bad, but I’m tired of the whole marijuana nonsense.”He later apologized to the Momtazis. But by then, Mr. Momtazi had had enough. He filed an incident report with the sheriff’s office and told them about the threatening calls. He installed cameras around the vineyard. And Hanna stayed overnight in case an arsonist showed up. Indeed every time the tussle made headlines, like when BuzzFeed wrote about it in August, the winery was subjected to another wave of threats.As a result, Mr. Momtazi became even more suspicious of the marijuana community. “It is a scare tactic they use,” Mr. Momtazi said of the calls. “That made me more firm.”Rick Olson, the former mayor of McMinnville and one of Yamhill County’s three commissioners at the Wagner hearing, met me at the Red Fox Bakery downtown for a cup of coffee. McMinnville has a quirky vibe, a cultural stew of aging hippies, hipsters with man buns and young professionals who enjoy the relaxed Oregon vibe.Each May the town celebrates its U.F.O. Festival, a weekend extravaganza with parades and costume contests. “We always say there is the Yamhill County and there is the rest of Oregon,” Mr. Olson said.In June, the commissioners voted to uphold the appeal in favor of Mr. Momtazi and the other neighbors. Mr. Olson said he was concerned about how much water Mr. Wagner’s processing facility might use, as well as the safety of the road shared with neighbors. “We upheld the appeal based on these issues,” Mr. Olson said. “It had nothing to do with whether we like marijuana or not.” Mr. Wagner is not out of the business altogether; he can still apply for a permit to grow marijuana commercially.The lawsuit filed against Mr. Wagner by his neighbors is pending. Mr. Wagner said the odds of being able to process at his farm are slim to none. Instead he would like to join a farm collective or find an investor to fund his operation. “No one ever really met me,” he said in an interview last week. “It’s like they act like I should go someplace else.”Mr. Momtazi sent an email last week with one of Mr. Wagner’s deleted Instagram posts that showed the barn against a brilliant sky at sunset. “Right now I am an island of love with an ocean of fear around me,” Mr. Wagner had written. Then, he added, “#xenophobia is #venom to the #haters and those they believe they #hate #manifestdestiny #cannabiscommunity.”Mr. Momtazi surmised that Mr. Wagner hasn’t exactly embraced them, either. Posts like that split their farm community, he wrote, “causing more hatred toward us.”"
5658c83038f0d86d6ede4616,Permanent Punk Invasion,2015-11-29,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/nyregion/permanent-punk-invasion.html,The New York Times,"“This is Pepe,” said Denise Mercedes, pulling out another cigarette and walking past her resplendent white cockatoo. “You should see him dance. He knows more about music than half the people I’ve played with.”Next to Pepe’s cage was Ms. Mercedes’s custom-painted, bejeweled electric guitar, the one she plays onstage with two heavy-metal tribute bands.On the walls she has hung her handmade tapestry-style quilts depicting robots, aliens and flying saucers. Ms. Mercedes says her art incorporates extraterrestrial themes dating to her U.F.O. sighting in 1984.On her kitchen table were record albums and photos from her days as a seminal figure in the Manhattan music scene. She was the founder and guitarist for the Stimulators, an influential punk band that disbanded in 1983.After that, Ms. Mercedes gave up music, but never her punk ethic. She married a solid, working-class man from Queens who rode motorcycles. A close encounter with what she described as a spectacular flying saucer off the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway put her on a path that led to her art and animal activism.In the past decade she has resumed playing, joining the two bands — Girls Girls Girls!, an all-female Mötley Crüe tribute group, and Bible Black, a homage to Black Sabbath — and performing with a third group, Terrestris, which she started recently.She still looks and dresses like a glam goddess rock star. On a recent weekday, she sported a glam hairdo, a nose ring and a skull ring on her finger.On her arms are numerous tattoos including a flying saucer, a flaming guitar — a Hagstrom, the Swedish company that sponsors her — and the words “Heavy Metal.”“This is my she-cave,” she said, entering the downstairs music studio at her house in Maspeth, Queens.Years ago, when Ms. Mercedes moved in, the neighbors did double takes at the bas-relief statue of Pan, the ancient Greek god of nature, that she mounted above her front door. It is a fitting welcome to her home, which is decorated in a futuristic “Lord of the Rings” style and shelters a menagerie of rescued animals, including three dogs, two indoor cats, a red-tailed boa constrictor, two chinchillas and, of course, Pepe.Outside are the feral cats that live in the huts she has set up in her small front yard, and the birds and squirrels that hang around out back, waiting for food.“I feed everybody,” Ms. Mercedes said.In her she-cave, there are shelves of books on extraterrestrial topics, and an original watercolor painting by Koko the gorilla.The funky, quilted collages on her walls celebrate animals and aliens. Flying saucers and robots are worked into a style that is a collision of medieval, glam and science fiction. She stopped at one in her hallway depicting a hovering mother ship welcoming aboard a Noah’s Ark roster of animals.“This is called ‘The Triumph of the Animals,’ ” she said. “They are rescuing the animals because humans have refused to.”Ms. Mercedes grew up on East 74th Street in Manhattan and then in Elmhurst, Queens. Her father was a longshoreman who played flute and piano. Ms. Mercedes taught herself guitar and fell in love with punk rock after hearing the English band the Damned at CBGB.“It was the punk-rock attitude I loved,” she said. “It’s the feeling that says, ‘I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m going to pick up a guitar and here I go.’ It’s the punk way of living and thinking, and I still have it.”In 1978, she began booking gigs for the Stimulators before even finding a singer. She rushed to the nightclub Max’s Kansas City and recruited a bar patron, Patrick Mack, who had no singing experience.“He wound up being the most incredible performer,” said Ms. Mercedes, who put her 11-year-old nephew, Harley Flanagan, on drums, which helped the band’s allure.“No one could believe this rocking band had, basically, a little kid playing drums,” she said.The Stimulators played CBGB, Irving Plaza, Paradise Garage, Danceteria and Max’s Kansas City, and shared bills with bands like Madness, Stiff Little Fingers, the Cramps and Bad Brains.The U.F.O. sighting came when she and her husband, Dave Jaklitsch, a crane operator, were riding home on his motorcycle. She said they saw a flying saucer dipping between the huge gas storage tanks on Maspeth Avenue in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.They rode up to the object and smoked cigarettes while watching it. After Ms. Mercedes waved, she said, it gave off a spectacular display of color and shot off.The sighting inspired her to begin attending U.F.O. meetings and conventions and compiling first-person accounts of other people’s encounters. It also steered her away from a “human-centric view” of things, she said, and fostered an interest in “interspecies communication,” whether dealing with animals or, possibly, aliens.These days, much of her communication is of the thrash-metal kind, especially with Girls Girls Girls! It was founded by Patricia Nilsen, a federal court reporter who plays bass in the group.Ms. Mercedes said her bandmates initially had only “a weekend at ladies’ rock camp” as experience.“But that vibe was there, that essence that made it work,” she said. “You don’t have to go to the Berklee College of Music. We took it and did it our way.”"
5838e6c77c459f2525d0e64f,Two Black Women Embrace Their Chance to Be Hockey Role Models,2016-11-26,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/sports/hockey/princeton-wisconsin-black-women-koelzer-nurse.html,The New York Times,"Three years ago, girls from the Hockey in Newark youth program were invited to meet the Princeton women’s hockey team.During the visit, the girls, many of whom are members of minorities, were drawn to defender Kelsey Koelzer. Like them, Koelzer, who is African-American, played much of her youth in secondhand equipment and was raised by a single parent who struggled to accommodate the costly expenses of hockey.The girls peppered Koelzer with questions. Koelzer was struck by the encounter, too; her mother, Kristine, still remembers her daughter talking about the effect the visit had.Koelzer’s influence is expanding in her senior season at Princeton. In June, she was selected first over all by the New York Riveters in the National Women’s Hockey League draft. Koelzer is believed to be the first African-American player taken No. 1 by a top-tier American professional hockey league. Shortly after the historic pick, Sarah Nurse of Canada, who is also black, was selected in the second round by the Boston Pride.Koelzer and Nurse, a forward at Wisconsin, are two of college hockey’s top players and rising stars in their national-team programs. With increased visibility, they recognize their capacity to motivate a generation of young girls from similar backgrounds.“I personally don’t know that I’ve played against many African-American people growing up,” Koelzer said recently after a game at Princeton, where she is captain. “I really do take pride in the fact that I could be a mentor and a model for other young girls, to see it really is possible if you put the work in no matter your situation or where you’re from.”Other inner-city youth programs like Hockey in Newark have striven to introduce hockey to new audiences, highlighting a sport that has not always been viewed as accessible for financial and cultural reasons.Despite these barriers, women of color have long been instrumental in the emergence of women’s hockey in North America. The Canadians Angela James, whose father is black, and Vicky Sunohara, who is of Japanese descent, were early pioneers. For years, Julie Chu, who is Chinese-American, was a star on the United States women’s national team. Last season, Rachel Llanes, a Filipino-American, and Blake Bolden, an African-American, were key contributors as the Pride won the first Isobel Cup, the trophy awarded to the N.W.H.L. champion. In 2015, they won the Clarkson Cup with the Boston Blades of the Canadian Women’s Hockey League.Koelzer and Nurse expressed a desire to continue that legacy, to help shape women’s hockey as more inclusive as it continues to increase its audience. “Diversity is an important element of the N.W.H.L.,” Commissioner Dani Rylan said in an email.Earlier this year, Koelzer was recognized as one of the nation’s best offensive defenders, earning first team all-American honors and a spot on the United States under-22 team. According to U.S.A. Hockey, an African-American player has yet to make the women’s senior national team.Nurse, also a senior, is a lethal scorer, and she led the top-ranked Badgers in points entering this weekend’s games. She has already competed in the Four Nations Cup with the Canadian national team and was an alternate captain of the developmental team last summer, when she played against Koelzer. Both hope to eventually compete at the Olympics.John Sanful, the executive director of Ice Hockey in Harlem, said it was “incredibly important” that children from minority groups are able to “see people on the ice who look like them,” particularly at such high levels of competition. Over the summer, girls from his program were assigned to report on an influential figure in their lives, and one chose Koelzer, writing, “I like that she’s a black female that wanted to be a hockey player and she achieved her goal.”For some players, hockey rinks can occasionally be uninviting. Tarasai Karega, who won a Division III national title at Amherst in 2009, started playing when she saw the film “The Mighty Ducks,” influenced by the character Jesse, the only black player portrayed on the team. Karega said that even entering a rink now can feel unsettling.“It’s tangible that people stare at you like a U.F.O. just landed on Earth,” Karega said. “They’ll speak to you in mannerisms or talk about proper English.”Karega stressed the importance of the emergence of players like Koelzer and Nurse, to continue raising awareness that hockey is not an exclusive sport.“I think it starts with having that conversation and defying stereotypes,” Karega said. “Then analyzing the nature of access to certain sports.”In 2012, William Douglas founded a blog named the Color of Hockey after Joel Ward received racist threats when he scored a series-clinching goal for the Washington Capitals against the Boston Bruins. Douglas said it was important to not just identify minorities within the sport but to understand they can be resources for exposing “problems with diversity and issues where race can be involved.”Koelzer, who grew up outside Philadelphia, and Nurse, who is from Hamilton, Ontario, have not been afraid to confront race throughout their careers. In high school, when Koelzer still played on a boys’ team, an opponent directed a racial slur at her. Koelzer responded by hitting the aggressor across the head, showing that his ignorance would not be tolerated.“Usually, the game of hockey has been very good to me,” Koelzer said. “When that does happen, I have an extreme sense of pride for who I am and where I came from. I do have that kind of attitude where I’m not going to let anyone put me down and try to rise above me just based on something like that.”Nurse comes from one of Canada’s best-known sports families. Her father, Roger, was a lacrosse star. Her cousin Kia Nurse has won two national titles playing basketball at Connecticut. Kia’s brother, Darnell Nurse, is a top defender for the Edmonton Oilers.Before a game in New York this month, Darnell Nurse said Jarome Iginla was a major influence during his youth. He sees a similar opportunity for Sarah Nurse as she continues her career.Despite her family’s reputation, Sarah Nurse said opponents had sarcastically asked how she discovered hockey or if she was adopted.Recently, black athletes at Wisconsin have unified to address racial injustice on campus. Like many athletes there, Nurse posted a statement this month that condemned a student who wore a mask of President Obama with a noose around the neck to a Wisconsin football game.The statement also referred to episodes in which racial slurs had been used against black athletes and to discrimination in the classroom by students and professors.“Just with the climate of the country right now, it’s a national issue,” Nurse said. “As student-athletes, we want to make a difference on our campus and in our community if we can.”Nurse and Koelzer are focused on their senior seasons and have not decided if they will turn pro. The N.W.H.L. is in financial straits, and much of 2017 will be focused on the 2018 Olympics. But wherever their careers lead, they appear comfortable using their influence to effect change, much in the way the United States women’s national soccer team and W.N.B.A. players have addressed social issues.“I definitely take pride in it,” Koelzer said. “I’m happy to have that on my shoulders, and I’m happy to kind of carry that weight. It means that I’ve made something. It means that I’ve done something.”"
58811b3d7c459f2525d178ab,The Outsider Fair Made Art ‘Big’ Again,2017-01-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/arts/design/the-outsider-fair-made-art-big-again.html,The New York Times,"New York’s Outsider Art Fair, which opened Thursday, is celebrating its 25th anniversary. It made its debut in 1993 in the 19th-century Puck Building in SoHo’s northeast corner.I saw the first iteration, reviewed the second and wrote about it many times after that. I enjoy most art fairs for their marathon-like density of visual experience and information, but the Outsider fair quickly became my favorite. It helped make art big again.The focus of the fair, according to its founder, Sanford L. Smith, known as Sandy, was the work of outsider artists, a catchall phrase for many kinds of self-taught creators. (Mr. Smith credited the phrase to Roger Cardinal, the art historian and author of “Outsider Art,” published in 1972.) Outsider work connoted a certain purity — an unstoppable need to make art that was unsullied by the “insider” art world, with its fine-art degrees and commercial machinations that always struck me as rather hoity-toity.Distinct from folk artists who usually evolved within familiar conventions, outsider artists often worked without precedent in relative isolation. They could be developmentally disabled, visionary, institutionalized, reclusive or simply retirees whose hobbies developed an unexpected intensity and originality. The term has long been the subject of debate, and its meaning has become elastic and inclusive. But however the category was, or is, defined, the Outsider Art Fair, compared with other fairs, seemed the least pretentious, the least focused on money, the rawest, liveliest and most full of surprises.It was often extraordinarily uneven, yet it proved that just beyond the borders of the professional art world there lived a parallel universe of art-making, every bit as good as the (also uneven) insider one. And so much wilder and more diverse in every way.Year after year, the Outsider Art Fair hammered this point home, usually quite effectively, and on increasingly global terms. It played a crucial role in changing the shape of modern and contemporary art. Each successive version confirmed the status of the self-taught masters, some only recently discovered, or rediscovered: Adolf Wölfli, who died in 1930; Bill Traylor, in 1949; and Martín Ramírez, Joseph Yoakum and Henry Darger, who worked into the 1960s and ’70s. The fair exposed their work to a wider audience, while insinuating an alternate 20th-century canon.It is almost shocking to recall that the achievement of the great Morton Bartlett (1909-1992) was unveiled at the first 1993 fair by the dealer Marion Harris, who had acquired his work after his death. Harvard-educated, Bartlett was a freelance photographer and graphic designer who, between 1936 and 1963, devoted his leisure time to making and photographing anatomically correct half-size prepubescent girls (and the occasional boy) and their wardrobes. His work was as calm as it was obsessive, as perverse as it was innocent. It fit almost seamlessly into a history of insider setup photography that extended at least from Claude Cahun and Hans Bellmer to Cindy Sherman, Laurie Simmons and James Casebere.Bartlett vaulted instantly into the outsider pantheon, while disturbing the insider-outsider division. As did James Castle (1899-1977), introduced at the 1997 fair by the J Crist Gallery of Boise, Idaho. Born deaf and mute, Castle spent much of his life memorializing his family’s Idaho farm, the interiors and exteriors of its buildings, its surrounding fields. His drawings, sculpture and books were usually made with a combination of cardboard, string and a mixture of soot and saliva to resemble charcoal. They often suggested Vuillard at home on the range and also the quiet, inward art of Jasper Johns.The list of artists whose work received first or early exposure at the fair is staggering and continues to grow. Some of the better-known names include the developmentally disabled sculptor Judith Scott (1943-2005), whose wrapped-yarn assemblages were shown at the fair by Ricco-Maresca Gallery in 2001 and given a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum in 2014; the Nebraska farmer Emery Blagdon in 2004 — who until his death at 78, in 1986, created wire-metal scrap sculptures and environments that he saw as healing machines, not art; and Melvin Way, shown by Margaret Bodell, also in 2004: a mentally disturbed, homeless New Yorker whose small felt-tip drawings embedded mysterious equations in areas of darkness, evoking higher math pulsing through the night sky.There were also Ionel Talpazan’s radiant spaceships and galaxies, the result, he said, of U.F.O. encounters as a child in Romania, before he came to New York. You could see his work in the fair at American Primitive Gallery in the late 1990s, and when you staggered out into the January cold, Talpazan, who died at 60 in 2015, would often be there, on the sidewalk, selling pieces.As part of the fair’s current anniversary celebration, the historian and critic Edward M. Gómez has organized an exhibition of 25 works that offers an object-oriented timeline: Each work appeared in one of the fair’s 25 iterations.Entering the fair on opening night had its rituals: getting through the line at the door, past the coat check and into the relative warmth where the Puck’s high ceilings, lustrous dark-wood floors and eccentric layout seemed perfect. Until her retirement in 2009, Phyllis Kind occupied the first booth. Arguably the doyenne of American outsider art dealers, she had galleries in Chicago and New York. In the early 1970s, she mounted the first solo show in a commercial gallery of Ramírez’s work, soon after it was rediscovered by the artist Jim Nutt (whom she then represented). A few years later, she introduced Darger, the Chicago recluse whose illustrated epic of the battling Vivian Girls emerged only after his death in 1973.Sharp of mind, eye and tongue, Ms. Kind was a formidable, stimulating presence. You could talk to her for days about art, and her booth was always full of great stuff. And yet I viewed her with a certain ambivalence in this setting. I couldn’t wait to get to the rest of the fair, to skim, following my eye to see, and perhaps ask about, the next newly discovered artist.I know the annual humbling of the Outsider Art Fair changed me, making me more open, less tolerant of rules and orthodoxies, more understanding of the human urgency to make art and how widespread it is. I also think it changed the art world, expanding it and in the process rendering the outsider phrase all but obsolete. It seems so 20th century now to choose one side and look down on the other. Now the art world is full of galleries that represent both; those in the 2017 fair include Nicelle Beauchene, Jack Hanley, Shrine and Y Gallery, all from the Lower East Side. A result of the closeness is that contemporary art feels more free than it has in decades.In some ways outsider art was the antidote to the stringencies and anti-object attitudes of Conceptual Art, which like outsider art began to gain critical mass in the 1970s. It might also be seen as finishing the job of recomplicating and rematerializing art that began in the 1980s, especially with Neo-Expressionist painting.Of course, the fair did not act alone. Many curators did their bit, including Lawrence Rinder, who introduced the great quiltmaker Rosie Lee Tompkins (1936-2006) at the Berkeley Art Museum; Matthew Higgs, who as director of White Columns, has regularly featured solo shows of outsiders including Judith Scott; and Lynne Cooke, who mounted an exhibition of the Ivory Coast artist Frédéric Bruly Bouabré at the Dia Art Foundation in 1994.It is a measure of the speed with which these artists have reshaped the contemporary art world that in late 1993, the New Museum collaborated with the Museum of American Folk Art (now the American Folk Art Museum) on a large retrospective of Thornton Dial, the Alabama creator of haunted, gnarly relief paintings. Only 20 years later “The Encyclopedic Palace” delivered a sprawling mixture of insiders and outsiders at the 2013 Venice Biennale. It was organized by Massimiliano Gioni, artistic director of the New Museum.The art world’s fluctuating attention to folk and then outsider art forms a complex history that runs throughout the 20th century, with each generation producing its advocates and institutions worldwide. In New York, both the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, opened in 1929 and 1931, collected folk art at first and then stopped, deaccessioning many of their holdings. Now they are back, in a way, collecting so-called outsider art. The Outsider Art Fair has contributed to this immeasurably meaningful sea change."

59377a727c459f24986e3d16,A ‘Lost’ John Lautner House Is Found and Restored,2017-06-07,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/fashion/lost-john-lautner-house-trina-turk.html,The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES — Three years ago, Trina Turk, a fashion and housewares designer who channels the sunny optimism of California, logged onto the real estate website Curbed.com and felt her blood pressure spike. On that day, the site ran an item about a house designed by the late midcentury architect John Lautner that had mysteriously slipped off the radar for 65 years.The story was brief and the details sketchy: The house was built in 1948, it was in the Echo Park neighborhood and it had been owned by one family for decades. Curbed quoted a listing agent and told readers that the “long-lost” Lautner would hit the market within days.Along with her husband, Jonathan Skow, Ms. Turk is passionate about architecture and design. The couple own two historic homes: a Streamline Moderne built in Palm Springs in 1936 and nicknamed Ship of the Desert for its yachtlike scale and swooping lines, and a 1940s post-and-beam in Silver Lake designed by J. R. Davidson that serves as the couple’s main residence.Each house was painstakingly and expensively restored by the couple, and each got the full-color shelter-mag treatment. For one visiting journalist, Mr. Skow — a photographer and the designer of the couple’s men’s wear line, called Mr. Turk — mixed up lime sours while Ms. Turk, dressed in a bright print caftan of her own design, showed off the desert view from the “ship” windows.“It’s almost a stewardship for them — they really love taking care of these gems,” Barbara Bestor, an architect who designed the couple’s Los Angeles showroom, said. “Trina said to me once, ‘Well, we didn’t have children, so we like taking care of these houses.’”For house collectors in Southern California, there is no better score — no child more golden — than a Lautner dwelling. The architect’s bold, experimental, sui generis houses are marked by floating concrete roofs and forests of redwood paneling, and suggest a master of the universe in residence. Perhaps that’s why Lautner houses are a favorite of Hollywood directors, who have cast the Garcia House as the lair of an international drug dealer in “Lethal Weapon 2,” and the Sheats-Goldstein Residence as the bachelor pad of the pornographer Jackie Treehorn in “The Big Lebowski.”In reality, the Sheats-Goldstein Residence is owned by an eccentric developer and fashion peacock named James Goldstein, who announced last year that he was donating it to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The move seemed to confirm that a Lautner house was less an assemblage of brick, wood and insulation than a habitable sculpture.The club of Lautner owners is peopled with the rich and famous, among them the designer Jeremy Scott; the actress Kelly Lynch and her husband, the screenwriter Mitch Glazer; the art-book publisher Benedikt Taschen, who restored the architect’s most famous design, Chemosphere, a disc-shaped U.F.O. floating above a canyon; and the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who in 2014, with her husband at the time, the Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, paid $14 million for what Curbed described as a “lesser Lautner” in Malibu.Crosby Doe, a Southern California real estate agent who specializes in architecturally significant properties, said Lautner rivaled Richard Neutra as the region’s most sought-after dead architect. “There’s quite a bit of competition for them when they come up for sale,” said Mr. Doe, who three years ago oversaw the sale of Lautner’s famed Silvertop house for $8.55 million to Luke Wood, the president of Beats by Dre.News of the “long-lost” Lautner echoed around Los Angeles and the world. The architecture community marveled at how a home designed by a modernist genius could go unnoticed for decades. And the under-a-million listing price ($999,000) gave aspiring masters of the universe — junior agents at William Morris and design-minded directors with a few IMDB credits — the hope that they, too, could bed down under a floating Lautner roof.Ms. Turk tried to get a sneak peek, but the property was fenced off, so she and Mr. Skow settled for attending the broker’s open. “They were very smart and scheduled a sunset open house with wine and cheese,” she said.The dusky light and vino helped to obscure the home’s modest size and beat-up condition. The carport had been enclosed at some point to make a clunky bedroom addition, and decades of exposure to the elements and lack of maintenance had taken a toll.Every architecture buff in town was there, and as they got a look at the three tiny rooms and the faded redwood on the sides of the house, the general reaction was the same, Mr. Skow said, “The whole tone was, ‘You would have to be insane to buy this.’”But Mr. Skow and Ms. Turk felt otherwise. The 1,100-square-foot house sat perched, like a glass-walled jewel box, on a hillside lot an acre in size, facing west toward the Pacific.“The funny thing is we were blown away and said, ‘This is amazing!’” Mr. Skow said. “And everybody was walking around going, ‘Oh my God, this is a nightmare.’”Ms. Turk added: “We’ve been on enough architecture tours to see what potential a house could be. It sounded like a fun project.”The official name for the “lost” Lautner is the Jules Salkin Residence, after the developer who commissioned it. It’s part of a group of houses the architect built early in his career with prefabricated roof structures, said Frank Escher, an architect in the Los Angeles firm Escher GuneWardena and an author of a definitive book on Lautner, “Between Earth and Heaven.”By 1948, Lautner was a decade or so removed from studying under Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Ariz. He had moved to Los Angeles to assist Wright on residential projects and establish his own practice, where he promoted his mentor’s style of organic modernism, blurring the lines between indoor and outdoor spaces. When Lautner submitted the building plans for the Salkin Residence to the city, he didn’t yet have his architect’s license — that came in 1952 — and another man had to sign for him, said Louis Wiehle, an architect who worked with Lautner in those days.Somehow, the Salkin Residence, which was completed around the same time as more acclaimed Lautner projects like the Desert Hot Springs Motel, was left out of the architect’s list of works when it was assembled by his devotees years later. It didn’t appear among the buildings compiled on the John Lautner Foundation website. Mr. Escher saw only a model for the house among Lautner’s own disorderly records, leading him to refer to it in his book as “the unbuilt Salkin House.”“I was completely stunned,” Mr. Escher said of his reaction to hearing of its existence. “It was an incredible stroke of luck that the house was discovered.”Part of the reason the house went unnoticed for decades is that the owners never celebrated it. There were no Dwell magazine shoots or tours sponsored by the MAK Center for Art and Architecture — the sorts of promotion that savvy owners of architecturally significant houses employ to raise market values and gain personal publicity.Melinda Maxwell-Smith grew up in the Salkin Residence. For her, it wasn’t so much lost as always there, taken for granted. She said her parents bought the house from the original owner for $12,000 in 1949, when she was 10 months old.Her parents were 1950s bohemians. “My mother ran something called Bobby’s Burger Bar,” Ms. Maxwell-Smith said. “My father had been taken on as a photographer at The L.A. Times. He liked to hobnob with artistic people and forward thinkers. He was friends with Edward Weston. They hosted Democratic club meetings in the home and jazz sessions.”Growing up in the house, Ms. Maxwell-Smith didn’t always have a happy childhood. She shared the larger of the two tiny bedrooms with her older brother, Melton, using the folding privacy screen Lautner designed to divide the room. But she could often hear her alcoholic father arguing with her mother through the thin walls. She would run outside and escape up the hill into Elysian Park.Moreover, Lautner’s progressive architecture stuck out uncomfortably from the neighbors’ clapboard and stucco piles (“Everyone thought we were rich,” Ms. Maxwell-Smith said), and the place was rife with quirks. Built on a flat pad level with the earth, the house practically invited bugs to crawl in. The glass walls were poorly sealed, so when it rained, she said, “we had two inches of warm water in the house.”“You knew not to touch the fridge or stereo or you’d get a shock,” she continued.But Lautner’s genius was nevertheless evident at that early stage of his career, when he was working with perhaps a $15,000 budget, modest even in 1940s dollars. Mr. Wiehle singled out the roof, so unusual in its construction that it was called “odd” in the city building plans. Instead of using wood-frame or post-and-beam construction, Lautner created wing-shape structural bents at eight-foot intervals across the length of the house. At the center, two rows of columns support the structure, meaning the roof can float free from the glass walls like a parasol.“The roof is what individualizes the house,” Mr. Wiehle said. “It’s a very striking design. It establishes the importance he felt for a sheltering roof that allows for free play beneath it.”Ms. Maxwell-Smith’s parents divorced when she was 10, and her mother, Barbara, remarried and stayed in the house until 1994. By then a widow, Barbara moved in with her boyfriend in Glendale and rented the place to an Australian filmmaker and his family, who stayed 17 years.Ms. Maxwell-Smith’s younger half brother, Steven Gutierrez-Kovner, who also grew up in the house, became a real estate agent, and he knew the potential value of a Lautner, even a modest early-career one in rough shape. After their mother died, in 2012, the three siblings agreed to sell it.The process has caused Ms. Maxwell-Smith to reflect on her years in the house and appreciate, in retrospect, Lautner’s forward-thinking design genius.“Now there’s all this stuff about grounding, the importance of being in touch with the earth,” Ms. Maxwell-Smith said. “Lautner’s intent was to keep people close to nature. You’re walking on the earth; you’re not rising above it. I didn’t recognize living there as the privilege that I do now.”One September day, in 2015, a little more than a year after the lost Lautner was put up for sale, Mr. Skow stood in the living room, flanked by a contractor, Marshall Knoll, and Ms. Bestor, whom the couple hired to undertake the Salkin Residence restoration. The house was a construction zone. The interior had been stripped down to the distinctive red concrete floor. The glass walls had been removed and a breeze was blowing in. It was the start of a major undertaking.Mr. Skow and Ms. Turk paid $1.2 million for the house, beating out 14 others, including the bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Even a “nightmare” Lautner had started a bidding war. The couple also wrote a letter to Ms. Maxwell-Smith’s family explaining their intentions. Wisely, the words “tear down” did not appear.“They wanted to renovate this house, bring it back to its original intent,” Ms. Maxwell-Smith said. “It touched our hearts.”Tall and bald, with chunky black eyeglasses worn as a trademark accessory, Mr. Skow gives off the air of a thrift store-shopping artist who has happened into a windfall but remains unchanged. The success of the fashion line, which has 13 stores, has made bigger art projects possible.“We could afford it and it was something exciting to buy,” Mr. Skow said of the Salkin Residence. “More exciting than going to Barneys or something like that.”He added: “We knew the project would be interesting and that it always costs a lot of money. The real question was, after it’s done, is it going to make our life more enjoyable or less enjoyable by having another house?”The couple’s relaxed attitude, combined with their desire to preserve rather than remake or gut a home, makes Mr. Skow and Ms. Turk easy and fun to work with, Ms. Bestor said.“As an architect, you don’t have that pressure of someone saying, ‘I love the house, but how can I have a walk-in closet here?’” Ms. Bestor said. “Because it’s a passion project — it’s not like someone has to move in here tomorrow — they’re able to restore it in a way that you couldn’t with someone on a deadline.”Ms. Bestor, who also worked on the restoration of Silvertop, a Lautner house on a much grander scale (and got married there as well), likened the Salkin Residence to one of the pavilions that Wright’s students built in the desert at Taliesin West.“It’s a beautiful glass pavilion on this one-acre lot,” she said. “You could almost have an outdoor concert below and have the house be a reception space.”The project ultimately took more than two years to complete. It would be more than a year from that September day until Ms. Turk and Mr. Skow could even think about furniture.During that time, the couple, along with Ms. Bestor and Mr. Knoll, studied Lautner’s drawings. They worked to retain the original floor plan and transparent feel of the glass walls, while updating the materials and using modern technology to solve the waterproofing issues that had frustrated previous residents and so damaged the house.“Nothing is getting expanded, the bathrooms aren’t twice as big,” Ms. Bestor said. “I think we’re changing the tub into a shower.”The ill-conceived bedroom addition was ripped out and the carport restored, the sagging foundation was lifted and the redwood siding was sanded down and restained to a luster. Much of the day-to-day managing of the project fell to Mr. Skow, while Ms. Turk saw to their fashion and housewares line and weighed in on the material choices and finishes.“Jonathan was horrified that I wanted black kitchen countertops,” Ms. Turk said.Last fall, the couple began furnishing the house, mostly with vintage pieces they had bought over time at Los Angeles-area flea markets, like a Danish sofa and a Neutra coffee table. They also added colorful rugs they had picked up on a trip to Morocco, in keeping with the low-key bohemian vibe.For Mr. Skow, the finished house feels like a groovy 1960s or ’70s hippie cabin. “The thing I love about it is there’s this weird rustic element mixed with this super space-age quality,” he said.They envision the Salkin Residence as an office for Mr. Skow and a place where the couple will host out-of-town guests.“When the glass doors are open, it feels magical in here,” Mr. Skow said. “It’s a transcendent experience. It’s totally cool.”But he and Ms. Turk aren’t taking much time to stop and admire the finished project. They recently bought a house at Sea Ranch, the ’60s utopian community in Northern California. It’s an 850-square-feet home designed by the architect Joseph Esherick.“It’s in decent condition,” Mr. Skow said. “But it does need some attention.”He laughed. “We’re on to the next.”"
57befa0a7c459f21c9997847,Cass McCombs: Imagine Beckett as a Cranky Singer-Songwriter,2016-08-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/arts/music/cass-mccombs-mangy-love-interview.html,The New York Times,"Cass McCombs’s words are a black hole. “It is not wealth to have more than others,” this 38-year-old singer-songwriter intones on “It,” a serene and unsettling ballad from his new album, “Mangy Love.” And then, a bit later: “It is not health to take vitamins and exercise.” His lyrics, whether lofty or cranky, often imply that very little is what it seems and that we are all probably doing wrong, or paying into a rotten system. A song is a gift, but what kind of gift is this? What kind of dude is this?By an unmarked route, Mr. McCombs has become one of the great songwriters of his time. His music, through nine albums and especially on “Mangy Love” — out Friday, Aug. 26, on Anti/Epitaph — is influenced by ’70s West Coast funk and the Grateful Dead continuum, has become light, patient and groovy. His boyish voice remains steady and even, pushing up into falsetto range. You want to trust it, even when you can’t face what it is telling you.He’s a little unfashionable for indie rock and has only an indirect relationship with the jam-band scene. His songs are not anthems, confessions, protests or poetry. His characters give voice to paranoia, psychosis and pettiness, but their author isn’t telling you what to think. They can withhold crucial details and contain Beckett-level humor, dry and dark. His music is easy on the ears and unending pain on the logical and moral centers of the brain.In the past, Mr. McCombs has been uncomfortable and unforthcoming in interviews — he doesn’t like self-aggrandizement — or has preferred they be conducted in unusual ways, such as by mail. But when we met last month, he asked only for a quiet place. Small and soft-spoken, he met me outside the American Museum of Natural History, and we walked around Central Park until we found an isolated bench, where he waited for my first move.I told him I associated him with a Northern California tradition of mystical cynicism: the less cuddly aspects of the Dead up through the scrofulous noise of Flipper, the media-sabotage of Negativland, the death fixations of Metallica. He winced, then confirmed that all those groups were important to him growing up. But he didn’t feel regional in that way. He thought that New Yorkers were just the same. (He has a theory that everyone desires the apocalypse.) “Lou Reed seemed pretty cynical,” he said. “Woody Allen seems pretty cynical.”That’s true, I said, but they are also sentimental, whereas in Mr. McCombs’s songs there is very little redemption. He narrowed his eyes. “What’s redemption?” he asked. That’s what kind of dude this is.He was a little wary. He went monosyllabic when I asked about his upbringing. He grew up in Northern California in a bluegrass-playing family; his biography of moving from place to place as a young man, including a period in New York City during the early aughts, involved a lot of the word “drifting” rather than explanations of intent. (He splits his time now between the Bay Area and New York.)But I mostly wanted to know what the songs on “Mangy Love” were about, and to my surprise, he obliged. “I usually don’t talk about my lyrics,” he said, “because people don’t ask.” Is that because he seems reluctant? “I have been unwilling in the past,” he allowed, “and then people stopped asking.”I figured that “Opposite House” was about the human condition — “the ceiling’s on the floor,” “rain inside when it’s sunny out.” In fact, he said, the song is about mental illness. “It” seemed like a linguistic game, using ambiguous pronouns and referring to a life-changing event without providing a clear point of reference. Actually, no: Mr. McCombs said he once saw a U.F.O. As for “Run Sister Run,” an easy jam with an Antillean rhythm, I drew a blank. It seems like a jivey do-gooder’s praise-rap for womankind, but I couldn’t dope out the intent. (“Don’t call my sister no concubine,” the narrator cautions, grandiosely. “She is the mother of creation.”)He explained that the song was written from the point of view of a “righteous dude” who — to paraphrase what he said — has one foot in Zuccotti Park and one foot up his own backside. “I’ve tried writing songs from a feminine perspective, and they fail, I think,” he said. “I wanted to write a song for my sisters but didn’t want to speak for them. So I figured I could just be someone who is not unlike me, and try to do what I can. You know, pitch in, or something.”He laughed. Is it a song from the point of view of a male ally to women, then? “Part of me thinks I am a male ally,” he reasoned. “But it’s not really for me to say.” So even to call yourself a male ally is to be deluded? “Exactly,” he said. In talking to Mr. McCombs, the black hole assumes its own rules.Toward the end of “Medusa’s Outhouse,” one of the record’s most musically beautiful and lyrically opaque songs, Mr. McCombs changes from singing to speaking. “If it’s so easy, you try,” he says, dryly. “Here. You try.” He repeats the line several times, as if rehearsing, wanting to get it right. What’s that about?He referred to George Costanza in an episode of “Seinfeld,” obsessing over a comeback line for a co-worker, to the point where he flies to Ohio to deliver it, and the line bombs. But he allowed that there was a little autobiography in the thought. “I’m trying to demand respect, not just for me, but for my kind,” he declared. Who is his kind? “Working-class musicians who have been exploited and underappreciated and dismissed,” he said. Implicating himself again, he explained that he works in a business — the music business — that he finds embarrassingly corrupt and sexist.But “if it’s so easy, you try” has a kind of Beckett-like, universal ring, too. I suggested it would look good on his tombstone. At that, his tightness disappeared: He laughed easily."

Woefully bereft of fish-eye music videos, for one. Sean “Puff Daddy” Combs’s onetime rap dynasty sold millions of slick singles by Faith Evans, Mase, Lil’ Kim and 112; now those artists reunite in tribute to the label’s fallen star, Notorious B.I.G, who would have been 44 on Saturday.

(Stacey Anderson)Battles (Thursday) These righteous avant-garde rockers from New York conjure a spectral parade; the stage show for their cameo-heavy 2011 album, “Gloss Drop,” projects the disembodied heads of their guest vocalists behind live instrumentation. It proved truly eerie how well the bawdy, floating face of Gary Numan complemented their abstract funk swagger. The group released an equally solid new record, “La Di Da Di,” last fall.

Now, with his project Car Seat Headrest, he releases the studio album “Teens of Denial,” a promising collage of arcane references, knotty confessionals and sturdy lo-fi rock rumbles. At 7 and 9 p.m., Rough Trade NYC, 64 North Ninth Street, Brooklyn, roughtradenyc.com; sold out. (Anderson)Lady Lamb (Saturday) On her second album, “After,” which landed last year, the singer-songwriter Aly Spaltro (a.k.a. Lady Lamb) weaves plenty of anecdotes — on heartbreak, on familial love, on U.F.O. sightings. The disparate topics are grounded in Ms. Spaltro’s adroit folk-pop guitar playing and wintry vocals, which recall somber peers like Angel Olsen and Sharon Van Etten.

(He championed her heartily, as has Sleater-Kinney.) Gleeful yet incisive in her blue-streak rhymes about gender identity, sex and other hot-button topics, with assertive hooks to match, she electrifies on her second trap- and electro-leaning studio album, “Big Grrrl Small World,” released last December.

57ad03247c459f21c9993920,New York Today: A Drone Invasion,2016-08-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/nyregion/new-york-today-drones-in-new-york.html,The New York Times,"Updated, 11:53 a.m.Good morning on this heavenly Thursday.Swarms of them are descending on New York.Not birds. Not U.F.O.s. Not mosquitoes.Drones.Starting Friday on Governors Island, more than 100 drones will zip across the sky, some as fast as 60 miles per hour, at the second annual U.S. National Drone Racing Championships.To fly them, nearly 150 pilots — selected from more than 1,000 who tried out at qualifiers around the country — wear goggles that allow them to see from the drone’s perspective.The pilots will fly their drones through gates, slalom past flags and show off acrobatic tricks, participating in several individual and team races.Up for grabs: bragging rights, cash prizes and a chance to compete on Team U.S.A. at the first-ever world championships for drone racing this October in Hawaii.So who’s favored to win? Which drones are creating the most...buzz?“It’s all up in the air,” said Scot Refsland, who has a Ph.D. in virtual reality and is the chairman of the Drone Sports Association.Literally.“The level of piloting skill is 100 times what it was one year ago, and they range from 12-year-old kids to 40-year-olds,” he added. “My money is on the 12- to 15-year-olds.”(We’re rooting for Steve Zoumas, one of the only pilots from New York. But he’s 31 years old.)New this year — and perhaps the most exhilarating to watch, according to Mr. Refsland — is the freestyle contest, which he said rivals watching pro skateboarders like Tony Hawk or Shaun White.“Who hasn’t had the dream of flight?” he added. “This is the sport that lets you have superhero powers.”(General admission is free, and you can find the schedule here.)Here’s what else is happening:It’s perfect flying weather.Today there will be minimal cloud cover, a slight breeze and a high of 82.And with plenty of sun, it’s pretty stellar for us on the ground as well.• The new Tappan Zee Bridge has reached a milestone: It’s halfway done.

577593e838f0d87c9d837959,"Tony Oursler’s Grand Illusions, Science Left at the Door",2016-07-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/arts/design/review-tony-oursler-the-imponderable-archive-hessel-museum-of-art.html,The New York Times,"In Paris in the early 1780s, Franz Anton Mesmer was attracting attention for his showy demonstrations of “mesmerism,” or what would later be called hypnotism. King Louis XVI appointed a commission that included Benjamin Franklin, America’s ambassador to France, to investigate.The commissioners’ report debunked Mesmer’s theory of “animal magnetism” and proffered comments — widely attributed to Franklin — on the attractions of erroneous beliefs. “Truth,” averred the writer, “is uniform and narrow,” but in the field of error, “the soul has room enough to expand herself, to display all her boundless faculties and all her beautiful and interesting extravagancies.”The observation is aptly quoted in the doorstop of a catalog for “Tony Oursler: The Imponderable Archive,” a fascinating and amusing exhibition at the Hessel Museum of Art at the Bard Center for Curatorial Studies.The exhibition consists of 680 items from a collection of more than 2,500 artifacts dating back to the 18th century having to do with scientifically unsupportable beliefs. Compiled by the artist Tony Oursler, it includes photographs, paintings, drawings, manuscripts, books, pamphlets and mechanical devices. There are publications and objects items pertaining to Satan worshipers, flat-earthers, witches, magicians, alchemists, mesmerizers, Theosophists, spirit photographers and other imaginative and often fraudulent cosmologists, lunder glass on 35 tables.Mr. Oursler’s archive naturally brings to mind the collections of Jim Shaw that were exhibited at the New Museum last year. But whereas Mr. Shaw looks to amateur paintings and kitschy religious artifacts with the eye of a connoisseur, Mr. Oursler is less discriminating about visual or poetic qualities. His archive feels driven more by a philosophical preoccupation with relations between illusion and reality. The overall effect is like that of a giant Surrealistic collage, a crazy quilt of superstition, paranoia, perversity and idiocy. It’s great fun to peruse.One table displays photographs and ephemera pertaining to the career of a man named Charles Fulton Oursler (1893-1952), who was Tony Oursler’s grandfather. An amateur magician and successful editor, author and Hollywood screenplay writer, Fulton Oursler, as he was known, was a prominent debunker of the spiritualist-séance fad that arose in the 1920s. In the 1940s, after recovery from alcoholism thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous, he became a deeply religious Roman Catholic and wrote “The Greatest Story Every Told,” a best-selling life of Jesus.Fulton Oursler’s son — Tony’s father — Charles Fulton Oursler II, carried on the family legacy. He began as an editor at Reader’s Digest and then became editor in chief of the Christian magazine Guideposts. In that capacity, he founded a spinoff called Angels on Earth, which presents stories about intervention in human affairs by divine beings. Issues of the magazine are included in the exhibition.Tony, whose full name is Charles Fulton Oursler III, seems to have kept up the family business. In the 1990s, he became known for sculptures involving comically distorted faces and bodies of people projected onto stuffed dummies. Quietly mumbling and complaining, these figures were magically lifelike. At the same time, an obvious artifice created tension between the illusory and the real. The sculptures debunked themselves.Unlike those of his religiously observant predecessors, Mr. Oursler’s beliefs are hard to pin down. As an archivist, he acts like an anthropologist presenting his discoveries without evaluative comment. Different tables are devoted to topics like Scientology, U.F.O.s, mind-altering drugs and thought photographs supposedly made by projecting mental ideas or images onto film.The archive abounds in amusing surprises. On one table is a set of delightful colored-pencil cartoon drawings made by the director Federico Fellini from 1960 to 1990, including caricatures of Laurel and Hardy and a picture of a tiger in a room with similar pictures of tigers hanging on the walls. It’s eminently appropriate that the exhibition is presented on a college campus, as it should serve as an excellent study collection for students from a variety of disciplines including psychology, philosophy and art history.Accompanying the archive in the museum galleries are two of Mr. Oursler’s recent video installations. Each video is projected inside a large, black box with a wide window allowing viewers to watch from outside. “Le Volcan” involves staged comical scenes with people in fanciful costumes acting out magic ceremonies and séances. In “My Saturnian Lover(s),” a woman and a boy eagerly await the U.F.O. she believes is coming to take them away. In both presentations, a strange three-dimensional quality is created apparently by double exposure. Looking inside the box you see that this is accomplished by rear-projecting one video onto a screen and projecting another onto a mirror on the floor in front of the screen, which in turn projects the imagery onto the screen.At the Museum of Modern Art, a similar but much larger projection system has been built for Mr. Oursler’s 90-minute film, “Imponderable,” in which episodes from the history of spiritualist frauds and hoaxes are re-enacted while mystic flames, smoke and ectoplasmic phenomena come and go. At certain moments during the film’s progress, you feel breezes wafting over you and hear loud thumping under the theater’s risers.The crudeness of these effects is part of the generally comical spirit. But Mr. Oursler is making a larger point about the confusion between illusion and reality to which human beings seem to be congenitally susceptible. As Franklin’s group pointed out long ago, truth is often hard and boringly consistent. For most people, fantasies and myths are more compelling and easier to comprehend, especially if they are conveyed by charismatic charlatans and demagogues using deceptive technologies.Unlike his father and grandfather, Mr. Oursler is not a crusader for any particular belief system. He’s a secularist skeptic who entertainingly urges a circumspect view of any and all simple solutions to the mysteries of the universe. In these epistemologically perplexing times, that’s a valuable service."

We didn’t even get to see William. I know happy endings aren’t very X-ey, but come on!With such an obvious cliffhanger, it seems the door is wide open for even more adventures. Which would be great, because this “ending” left me bitter, angry and nearly throwing Thai food on my new carpet. What about you?[Related: Chris Carter Expects More ‘X-Files’]I had actually come around to the idea that alien DNA might be the human race’s salvation. The idea that the thing that scares us the most, that we are led to believe could pose the greatest harm, might be the only thing that can save us? I can work with that. But this episodewas just tedious. (Agent Einstein is back and she and Scully spent precious minutes talking complicated science while trying to find a solution, which they do. This was about as exciting as an episode of “NOVA.”)It was also all over the place. Agent Monica Reyes, who had come onboard in Season 8 and helped deliver William, possibly got more screen time in this episode than Agent Skinner did in the entire miniseries. She wasn’t a character I was clamoring to see again and neither was the infuriating Tad O’Malley, who flailed like a guppy out of water. He’s the voice of reason and he’s been right all along about his conspiracy theories? His advice is to “stay indoors”? Mine is turn him off.The grand threat to our species, the Spartan virus, was spread through the most trite means — mandatory inoculations, like for smallpox. I really hope Jenny McCarthy and her crew of anti-vaxxers were not watching this episode.I could not stop rolling my eyes at all of this. The breadth and length of the original series made it impossible to wrap up the “mythology” arc in just two episodes in a shortened season. And as bookends, the episodes seemed jarring and out of place. To make this feel more cohesive, it wouldn’t have taken much to seed bits of the Spartan virus plot in the other four episodes.Mulder finally has his day with “Old Smokey” (as he calls the Cigarette Smoking Man), but even though he had a gun, nothing really came of it, except that we see the terrifying sight of the CSM’s face, which was nearly destroyed by fire. Seems fitting, no? For some reason, he chose Agent Reyes as his minion and she went along because he bestowed alien DNA on her, protecting her from the impending virus.Scully, who also has alien DNA, is also safe and so is William. Scully literally gives her blood to save the world!Two small bits of good news: Scully doesn’t get knocked out in this episode and Mulder does actually see a U.F.O. in the presence of many witnesses. So, you know, one off the bucket list.Here’s what we still don’t know• Does Mulder make it?• Where is William? What is he like?• Why would this cabal of men set out to kill of humanity? There has to be a better answer than just playing God?• And finally, what was the point of it all? I guess I was a fool for thinking I’d get any answers. And after this disheartening ending, I’m not sure that I care see any more. I am happy with my “X-Files” memories and luckily, they are streaming into infinity on Netflix."

Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Obama and Cuba’s president, Raúl Castro, shared a cordial handshake at a welcoming ceremony in Havana and opened talks on normalizing relations, despite the continuing trade embargo and deep differences on human rights. More than 50 years of Cold War hostility “did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people,” Mr. Obama said. Watch their news conference, above._____2. Hillary Clinton resoundingly affirmed U.S. support for Israel, and jabbed at Donald Trump’s promise of “neutrality,” in a speech to the nation’s most influential pro-Israel lobbying group. Watch a clip, above. The only Jew among the presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders, was also the only one to decline to appear at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s annual policy meeting._____3. Mr. Trump took full advantage of his visit to Washington for the Aipac meeting. Ahead of his speech, he tried to build bridges with the Republican establishment, meeting with members of Congress, lobbyists and power brokers. He also released his long-awaited list of advisers on foreign policy and held a news conference, above, at a hotel he’s building. “If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement,” he said._____4. Our latest political poll reveals paradoxes in both parties. Republican primary voters are depressed and discouraged by the divisions in their party, but appear to be coalescing around Mr. Trump. Democratic voters appear more satisfied by the tenor of their race, but Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are virtually neck and neck.5. Apple’s product event, one of the shortest in memory, bucked its trend of bigger screens, introducing a smaller iPhone and iPad Pro. There was also a peek at the company’s U.F.O.-like new campus. And the chief executive, Tim Cook, above, defended Apple’s battle with the government over “our data and our privacy.” But then the Justice Department moved to potentially sidestep that confrontation, saying it might no longer need Apple’s assistance to extract data from an iPhone._____6. The director of a prominent tennis tournament, above with Serena Williams, apologized after setting off outrage with his comment that female players “ride on the coattails” of players like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Ms. Williams, who lost in the final at Indian Wells, Calif., said, “If I could tell you every day how many people say they don’t watch tennis unless they’re watching myself or my sister — I couldn’t even bring up that number.” And our columnist writes that his comments “went way beyond awkward, well into misogynist.”_____7. Some U.S. universities have bolstered sagging bottom lines by attracting international students. Idaho State, where one in 10 students is from the Middle East, has seen layers of cultural clashes and problems play out, including episodes of stalking, drag racing and plagiarism. But now, with low oil prices cutting into Mideast budgets, the number of foreign students may drop sharply._____8. Demonstrations across the country pressed for Senate Republicans to hold hearings for President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Above, a protest in Louisville, Ky. Chief Justice John Roberts criticized the politicization of the confirmation process in a speech 10 days before Antonin Scalia died. “We don’t work as Democrats or Republicans,” he said at a law school in Boston, but partisan fighting could give “a very unfortunate impression” otherwise._____9. The number of migrants landing on the Greek isles may have dropped to just a few hundred, two days after a deal made by the European Union mandated their return to Turkey. “The numbers show a significant decrease, but it’s too early to draw clear conclusions,” a Greek official said. The status of more than 50,000 migrants already in the country has not been addressed. Above, an encampment in Athens._____10. A shake-up in Big Pharma: The drug giant Valeant is replacing its chief executive, J. Michael Pearson. His once admired business model, focused on buying companies, slashing costs and raising prices on undervalued drugs, is now seen as an emblem of corporate greed. The company’s stock rose 7 percent on the news.U.S. stocks edged higher. The Dow and the S.&P. 500 rose 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq climbed 0.3 percent._____11. Lastly, researchers keep finding new surprises about parrots, which they say rival the great apes and dolphins for intelligence and resourcefulness. Some can count, some use tools and some even dance. And they are fierce foragers, disdaining fruit pulp in favor of the embryonic seed system. “A parrot is a plant carnivore,” one expert said. “It destroys the seed. It goes right in through the fruit and eats the plant baby.”_____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.Want to look back?

564dd6d038f0d81eb3ced27b,YouTube to Pay Fees for Some Video Makers to Fight Takedowns,2015-11-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/technology/youtube-to-pay-fees-for-some-video-makers-to-fight-takedowns.html,The New York Times,"WASHINGTON — Since its inception, YouTube has been embroiled in long and bitter battles over copyright infringement. And over the years, the video site has increased its policing of pirated material. But too often, the company says, the demands of copyright holders to take down videos go too far.Now, YouTube is taking the unusual step of financially supporting YouTube creators so they can fight back.YouTube said on Thursday that it would pick up the legal costs of a handful of video creators that the company thinks are the targets of unfair takedown demands. It said the creators it chose legally use third-party content under “fair use” provisions carved out for commentary, criticism, news and parody.An example of fair use is a segment by the TV host Stephen Colbert that rebroadcasts cable news clips for the comedian to react to.Constantine Guiliotis, who goes by Dean and whose channel dedicated to debunking sightings of unidentified flying objects has just over 1,000 subscribers, is one of the video makers YouTube will defend. Mr. Guiliotis has received three takedown notices from copyright holders of videos that he has found online and posted to his YouTube channel, U.F.O. Theater.In his videos, Mr. Guiliotis includes the videos he found but also provides analysis and commentary, which YouTube argues is within the guidelines of fair use rules. The site reposted the videos after its review and told Mr. Guiliotis it would defend him against any future legal action. Like the other creators YouTube has selected, Mr. Guiliotis has not been sued for his videos.“It was very gratifying to know a company cares about fair use and to single out someone like me,” Mr. Guiliotis said.YouTube is starting small, initially supporting four video creators, but it said it might expand its program.The company said it wanted to protect free speech and educate users on fair use. But its announcement is also is aimed at strengthening loyalty with video creators. YouTube faces new competition from Facebook, Twitter and traditional media companies that are trying to get consumers to upload more content onto their platforms.On Wednesday, in a sign of how competitive the online video business has become, YouTube named Neal Mohan its new head of product and design. Mr. Mohan has been a top advertising executive at Google, which owns YouTube.“We want, when we can, to have our users’ backs,” said Fred von Lohmann, legal director for copyright at YouTube. “We believe even the small number of videos we are able to protect will make a positive impact on the entire YouTube ecosystem.”Mr. Lohmann said the number of legitimate videos affected by takedown notices was small. And big entertainment companies are not always the most aggressive in demanding that the videos be removed. But the problem is growing, said Corynne McSherry, legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.“It’s become incredibly easy to take down legitimate content, and we need a counterbalance to that situation, so we welcome YouTube’s announcement,” Ms. McSherry said.Last spring, the Ohio Channel demanded that YouTube take down a video by the local chapter of Naral Pro-Choice, an abortion rights group, that contained video of a committee meeting. The clip of the meeting was part of a bigger video meant as criticism of the behavior of some lawmakers. The group is now one of the video creators that YouTube has vowed to protect from copyright suits.“We aren’t a large organization,” said Kellie Copeland, executive director of Naral Pro-Choice Ohio. “We just have six people here, so having YouTube’s support allowed us to not be afraid and to stand our ground on this situation.”An earlier version of this article misidentified the organization that asked YouTube to take down a video posted by a local Naral Pro-Choice chapter. The Ohio Channel requested the removal, not the Ohio Legislature."
55e876e138f0d82b9387d439,A Song Inspired by a Bizarre Love Triangle,2015-09-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/t-magazine/unknown-mortal-orchestra-music-video.html,The New York Times,"The initial concept for the psych-rock trio Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s third full-length album, “Multi-Love,” began with the title. “When I first wrote down the term ‘multi-love,’ I didn’t really know what it meant or why it resonated with me,” frontman Ruban Nielson explains. “But the meaning of it became more complex as the year went on.” Nielson set out to make a “happy record” — a seemingly painless undertaking. But when an unlikely friendship blossomed with a young woman on the road, it evolved into a love triangle between Nielson, his wife and “Woman X” — and complications set in.The trio lived together for about a year, along with Nielson and his wife’s two children, in the family’s Portland home while Nielson recorded the album — an unlikely fairy tale, which ended when Woman X’s visa ran out and she was forced to leave the country. The anxieties of a long-distance romance, and the limitations of a device-based connection, inspired the song “Can’t Keep Checking My Phone,” the video for which premieres here. “It’s about that moment when you’re sick of waiting for someone to get back to you, so you pretend you don’t have a phone to keep yourself from going crazy,” Nielson says.On the track, Nielson combines a thousand tiny fragments of sound into a disco-ball mosaic — psychedelic synths, rhythmic funk, electronic beats, lush falsetto — and produces a seductive dance-floor hit. The song inspired the director Dimitri Basil to create a collage of assorted images, like the “Mars Attacks!” trading cards he loved as a child. “The idea was to create a kind of deck based on strange occurrences, syndromes and phenomena,” Basil says. The resulting aesthetic is part sci-fi, part psychological thriller, where the 1950s U.F.O. craze meets “The Twilight Zone” and “The X-Files.” Some of the references are more recognizable: abduction, rapture, gender dysphoria. Others necessitate a Google search: Stendhal syndrome, panphobia, hybristophilia.More mysterious than the esoteric phenomena illustrated in the video is the concept of love itself, particularly when expanded from one locus of affection into three. Nielson is reluctant to discuss the relationship, but its influence on the record is evident. He seems intent on looking forward and leaving that crazy year behind him. But even after the emotional turmoil he endured during “Multi-Love,” his desire to approach his life and his art from a place of instinct, rather than logic, remains. “I’m always paying close attention to weird coincidences and patterns. I go through phases where I record things that seem significant and build my life and work around that stuff,” Nielson explains. “I make some pretty wild leaps of faith based on vague intuitions.”"
567c558538f0d83da904ecc8,"William Edmondson’s ‘Boxer,’ Presumed Lost, Goes to Auction",2015-12-25,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/arts/design/william-edmondsons-boxer-presumed-lost-goes-to-auction.html,The New York Times,"Poised to throw a jab, William Edmondson’s limestone “Boxer” was last purchased in 1949, right from the sculptor’s Tennessee yard. It was presumed lost until 2014, when the current owner briefly lent it to the Cheekwood Museum of Art in Nashville.Now the work — believed to be modeled after the fighter Joe Louis — is expected to bring $150,000 to $250,000 on Jan. 22 at Christie’s Outsider and Vernacular Art sale. The “Boxer” was said to have been a favorite of the sculptor, who died in 1951; kept on a shelf protected by an overhang, it was photographed by Edward Weston and Louise Dahl-Wolfe, among others.“It speaks to Edmondson’s understanding of the visual culture of that period,” said Cara Zimmerman, a Christie’s specialist in folk and outsider art. “This powerful African-American man who was able to cross over to be a hero for all Americans,” she noted, referring to Louis.Born in 1874, the son of freed slaves, Edmondson worked as a railroad laborer and then a hospital janitor before beginning to carve tombstones. In 1937, he became the first African-American artist to be given a solo show  at the Museum of Modern Art.“He is one of the stars of this field,” Ms. Zimmerman said. “He exemplifies what outsider art is at its core, at its best.”The “Boxer” also attests to Edmondson’s sophisticated way with a chisel: He was able to delineate the fighter’s smooth skin, the contour of his eyes and cheeks, his wiry hair. “The piece is lunging forward on the block,” Ms. Zimmerman said, “almost like jumping up from his stool and into the ring.”As Ionel Talpazan told it, at the age of 8 he was abducted by extraterrestrials in the Romanian countryside, after fleeing his foster home.This vision went on to inspire Mr. Talpazan’s outsider art. He was discovered in the 1980s and died in September, at 60.Now the Outsider Art Fair is featuring his work in its first curated booth devoted to a recently deceased artist. “Talpazan had such a critical impact on the New York-specific outsider art field that it was the right time to look back at the work and work that had never been shown to the public before,” said Becca Hoffman, the fair’s director.The fair, which takes place Jan. 21 through 24 at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Manhattan, will also highlight two other deceased self-taught artists: Alessandra Michelangelo, part of the Atelier Blu Cammello art workshop for mental health patients in Italy, whose work will be shown by Chris Byrne, a founder of the Dallas Art Fair; and Hawkins Bolden, whose yard of scarecrows made out of refuse will be recreated by Shrine gallery.Having sold his art on the street, Mr. Talpazan was eventually represented by Aarne Anton, who, after visiting him, gave the artist a show at his American Primitive Gallery in 1996. “His walls were covered with spaceships,” Mr. Anton said. “It was as if I walked into a space where nothing else existed.”At 18th Street and 10th Avenue, the Alexander and Bonin Gallery had long been located a bit south of its Chelsea counterparts. Now it is heading even farther downtown — to 47 Walker Street in TriBeCa.The gallery will reopen there this summer, in a larger space designed by Bade Stageberg Cox, a New York architecture and design firm.It isn’t easy to leave Chelsea, which has been home to the gallery for the last 18 years. But the price of real estate kept going up, and the building the gallery is in is coming down.Still, the dealers said that they were looking forward to the additional square footage and were not concerned about losing foot traffic.“We’ve always been a gallery people come to, to see the artists we represent,” said Ted Bonin, who, with his partner, Carolyn Alexander, represents John Ahearn, Peter Hujar and Doris Salcedo, among others. “We have enjoyed the peacefulness of this location and we’re going to achieve that again at Walker Street. It’s a beautiful block that is away from all the noise and rushing quality of much of Manhattan. You sort of feel you’ve stepped into another time.”In a way, the move represents a return, since the gallery originally opened in SoHo in 1995. The new exhibition space will occupy two floors and more than 7,000 square feet, which will include a basement area for video, sound work and performance. “It’s going to bring us much more flexibility,” Ms. Alexander said.The gallery moves out on Jan. 10, after which it will continue to operate in a temporary space at 265 Canal Street until the new site is ready. And while the move seems to signal a new chapter for Alexander and Bonin, the dealers indicated that it will largely be business as usual.“We still work with everyone we worked with when we opened,” Mr. Bonin said."

Mitchell, Sixth Moonwalking Astronaut, Dies at 85",2016-02-06,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/science/space/edgar-d-mitchell-sixth-moonwalking-astronaut-dies-at-85.html,The New York Times,"Edgar D. Mitchell, who became the sixth man to walk on the moon as a member of NASA’s first lunar mission devoted exclusively to scientific research, died on Thursday at a hospice in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 85.NASA announced his death, which came one day before the 45th anniversary of his moon landing.The Apollo 14 flight, launched on Jan. 31, 1971, took Commander Mitchell and his fellow Navy officer, Capt. Alan B. Shepard Jr., to the moon’s Fra Mauro highlands. Captain Shepard had been America’s first man in space 10 years earlier.Maj. Stuart A. Roosa of the Air Force remained in orbit snapping photographs of potential sites for future missions while awaiting his colleagues’ return in the lunar module.The first two flights to the moon — the epic Apollo 11 of July 1969 with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and Apollo 12 four months later — were largely devoted to testing whether men could survive there, albeit for a brief period. Apollo 13’s scheduled moon landing had been aborted by a near-disastrous oxygen tank explosion.For the 14th mission, scientists were counting on Commander Mitchell and Captain Shepard to be the first astronauts to return with a large collection of rocks from high elevations, where some might be old enough to provide clues to the moon’s origin and its evolution. (Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 had landed in fairly level areas.)Spending just over nine hours on two moonwalks, the astronauts collected more than 94 pounds of rock samples, piling them in a two-wheeled cart they were hauling. But they missed out on completing one important task.NASA had hoped that they could climb to the rim of the nearly 400-foot-high Cone crater and collect especially significant rock samples there. But in lugging the cart the astronauts found the climb to be difficult and experienced rapid heartbeats. Mission control, concerned about exhaustion and wary of time constraints, ordered them to turn back. Unbeknown to the men at the time, they were only about 20 yards from their goal.Commander Mitchell, who had a doctorate in flight sciences, had long maintained a parallel interest in the study of consciousness, a fascination that was heightened during his return from the moon.“It was a sense of the Earth being in critical condition, a recognition of the massive insanity which had led man into deeper and deeper crises on the planet,” he told the writer Francine du Plessix Gray in The New York Times Magazine in August 1974.“Above all, I felt the need for a radical change in our culture. I knew we were replete with untapped intuitive and psychic forces which we must utilize if we were to survive, forces that Western society had programmed us to disregard.”Heading home, Commander Mitchell secretly conducted an experiment in extrasensory perception — thought transference — while his fellow astronauts were asleep. He concentrated on symbols in a set of cards he had brought with him in the hope that four people he had selected back on Earth could read his thoughts and determine what those drawings were.In discussing the experiment at a news conference five months later, he said it produced “results far exceeding anything expected.” Of the 200 guesses by his contacts back on Earth, he said, 51 correctly identified his thoughts.Another Apollo 14 moment having nothing to do with rocks was provided by Captain Shepard, who took three golf balls with him to the moon.Wielding a makeshift 6-iron, he hit a shot, televised back to Earth, that traveled “miles and miles and miles,” as he put it, in lunar gravity only one-sixth that of the Earth. (The shot was presumed to have gone more than 800 yards, more than six times his normal range with a 6-iron back on Earth.)Edgar Dean Mitchell was born on Sept. 17, 1930, in Hereford, Tex., and grew up in Artesia, N.M. He became fascinated by flight when he watched crop duster pilots flying biplanes from an airfield near his home.He received a bachelor of science degree in industrial management from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh in 1952 and joined the Navy the next year.After flying fighter planes, he obtained another bachelor’s degree, in aeronautics, from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1961. He earned his doctorate, in aeronautics and astronautics, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964. He graduated from test pilot school, then joined the astronaut corps in April 1966.Apollo 14 was Commander Mitchell’s only spaceflight. He retired from NASA and the Navy in 1972 and at his death lived in Lake Worth, Fla., south of West Palm Beach.Mr. Mitchell’s two marriages ended in divorce. Survivors include four daughters, Karlyn, Elizabeth, Mary and Kimberly, and a son, Paul, according to the South Florida website TCPalm.com. Kimberly Mitchell is a former city commissioner of West Palm Beach.Mr. Mitchell owned a business consulting firm in South Florida but retained his interest in studying the mind.In 1973 he founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences, a California-based nonprofit that supports research in the field. Its name is derived from the Greek word variously defined as intellect or inner wisdom.Mr. Mitchell created a stir in 2008 when he told a British radio station that his contacts in military and intelligence circles had told him that “we’ve been visited on this planet, and the U.F.O. phenomena is real,” but that governments had “covered up” the matter for at least 60 years. (His boyhood home was 40 miles south of Roswell, N.M., site of the celebrated claim of an unidentified flying object crash and government cover-up in 1947.)NASA, Mr. Mitchell’s former employer, was quick to respond. “NASA does not track U.F.O.s,” a spokesman for the agency said. “NASA is not involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywhere else in the universe.”An obituary on Saturday about the astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell misstated how far a golf ball hit on the moon by Capt. Alan B. Shepard Jr., his fellow Apollo 14 astronaut, was presumed to have gone. It was more than 800 yards, not more than 800 feet.An obituary on Saturday about the astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell misstated the date of his birth in 1930. It was Sept. 17, not Sept. 19."
562f594038f0d82f94187e97,Touring the Dark Side of Los Angeles,2015-11-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/travel/things-to-do-in-los-angeles.html,The New York Times,"A tour through Los Angeles can be a bit like driving through one big, palm tree-lined cemetery. Lurking about the city’s grimy streets, manicured lawns and dusty canyons are homages to Hollywood’s dark past, from long-abandoned mansions to the iconic Hollywood sign itself where the aspiring starlet Peg Entwistle leapt to her death from the “H” in 1932, back when it still read Hollywoodland. (Her spirit is said to wander the nearby Griffith Park trails.) Perhaps because so many travel to Los Angeles with soaring expectations, the city — unwilling to embrace every fresh, new face — feels suffused with melancholy.Ms. Entwistle’s short career as siren and her untimely death at the age of 24 are emblematic of the strange dichotomy of the city: sparkling, yet dark; seductive, yet scary. Just beneath a shiny surface lies a graveyard of secrets and dirt. All around the city, from Hollywood to Compton, the duality of glitter in the dark is on view; you just have to know where to look. Fortunately for the noir-curious, an entire branch of tourism trafficks in the city’s underbelly. Call it Morbid Los Angeles.For the bookish fan of the macabre, there’s Esotouric (esotouric.com), a company run by Kim Cooper and Richard Schave, local social historians and true-crime enthusiasts. Their crime scene bus tours, which began in 2005, grew out of a mutual love of Raymond Chandler and forgotten scandals.Today, on a charter bus, the couple hosts tours with titles like “Blood and Dumplings” and “The Echo Park Book of the Dead.” The former tour takes passengers through the San Gabriel Valley to sites like the Alhambra chateau where the music producer Phil Spector shot the actress Lana Clarkson in 2003; a dumpling course from one of the many Chinese restaurants in the area is included. For the devotee of true crime, Esotouric’s excursions dive deep into cold case files, like the bizarre 1922 “Bat Man” case in which a housewife hid her lover and husband’s murderer in the attic.But Ms. Cooper and Mr. Schave also devote a fair amount of time to infamous tragedies like the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short, the young actress known as the Black Dahlia and one of the city’s oldest cold cases. Instead of theorizing about her killer, Esotouric’s Real Black Dahlia Tour portrays Ms. Short through the lens of the era, visiting her regular haunts (including the site where her body, torso cut in two, was discovered). To Ms. Cooper, Ms. Short is a case of an interesting nobody whose story is told only “when terrible things happen.”If Esotouric is for students of the arcane, then Dearly Departed (dearlydepartedtours.com) is for those who appreciate a bit of humor alongside a drive-by of Marilyn Monroe’s grave site. “It’s a lighthearted look at the dark side of Hollywood,” said the owner, Scott Michaels, whose decade-old company specializes in celebrity-focused dark matter including the notorious Manson family murders. His popular Manson-focused Helter Skelter Tour includes a circuit of the infamous Laurel Canyon murder site. For several years, chunks of Sharon Tate’s fireplace were distributed as unsettling souvenirs until the supply ran out.If a self-guided tour is preferred, Creepy LA (creepyla.com), a website about the city’s supernatural happenings, has a Google map dedicated to documenting hauntings. Within a few short blocks, ghost chasers can visit the ritzy Roosevelt Hotel where Montgomery Clift’s spirit is said to carouse with Marilyn Monroe’s, and pause outside the Knickerbocker Hotel, now apartments, where Rudolph Valentino was said to be a habitué of the bar. Bess Houdini, Harry Houdini’s widow, held a séance in 1936 on the Knickerbocker’s rooftop in a final attempt to communicate with the dead magician.Just down Hollywood Boulevard, another self-guided tour can be had at the Museum of Death (www.museumofdeath.net). This truly dreadful menagerie of dusty, death-soaked knickknacks includes the severed head of the Parisian serial killer Henri Landru; a collection of letters and art from serial killers; a diorama of a bunkroom of Heaven’s Gate, the San Diego-based U.F.O. cult, with an actual bunk bed acquired from the members’ mass suicide (Nike-clad mannequins included); and a faded quilt adorned with floral swastikas sewn by the Manson family, which guests brush by on their way out.Even the Los Angeles Coroner’s office finds currency in creepiness, opening a gift shop called Skeletons in the Closet, which sells body-silhouette mouse pads ($8), coroner cotton tote bags ($5) and Los Angeles County medical-examiner compact cooler totes ($18) perfect for a picnic lunch among the headstones in the idyllic Hollywood Forever Cemetery. (Cecil B. DeMille, Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino, to name a few, reside here.) And, spooky as it may sound, an al fresco meal so close to Tinseltown’s oldest masters is very Los Angeles."

565e416f38f0d8640ffa09bc,Economic Report Adds to Brazil&#8217;s Mounting Woes,2015-12-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/world/americas/economic-report-adds-to-brazils-mounting-woes.html,The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO — It keeps getting messier.A senator close to the president has just been arrested in a widening graft scandal. Lawmakers are wielding the threat of impeachment over the president, thwarting efforts to deal with the tumbling economy.And then, on Tuesday, Brazil reported its worst economic performance in two decades.The dismal result — the economy shrank 1.7 percent in the third quarter — is the culmination of months of economic crisis and political paralysis, casting a pall over Latin America’s largest country.What began as an inquiry into bribes at the national oil company, Petrobras, has mushroomed into a much larger scandal, ensnaring in recent days André Esteves, a billionaire investment banker, and Delcídio do Amaral, a senator in the governing Workers Party.The jailing of such powerful figures is creating even more gridlock in the capital, Brasília, as congressional leaders engulfed in the scandal stymie President Dilma Rousseff’s attempts to win approval for austerity measures. In turn, the uncertainty over Ms. Rousseff’s own political survival and her government’s leadership of the economy is deepening the crisis of confidence in the nation.Investment plummeted 15 percent in the quarter from the same period a year earlier. If current trends persist into 2016, as many economists forecast, Brazil could face its first consecutive years of economic contraction since 1929-30.Brazil “is now mutating into an outright economic depression,” said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs, in a report analyzing the gross domestic product figures. Mr. Ramos said he expected Brazil’s economy to shrink at least 2.3 percent in 2016 after shrinking 3.6 percent this year.A rebellious Congress is pushing Ms. Rousseff’s weak government into a corner. Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the lower house, is threatening to start impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff unless legislators in her party refrain from seeking his ouster over the revelation of undeclared Swiss bank accounts in his name, according to news reports.With the resistance in Congress to austerity measures, Ms. Rousseff’s government announced a freeze on discretionary spending in December. While public employees will continue to receive their salaries and public pensions will be paid, the federal government said it would halt spending on items like plane tickets, electricity and hotel stays.The economic figures reported on Tuesday reflected the worst decline in gross domestic product since at least 1996, according to Brazil’s statistics agency, standing in stark contrast to the boom the country experienced in the century’s first decade. Growth surged to 7.6 percent in 2010 after the authorities increased public spending on everything from a U.F.O. museum to World Cup facilities and remote railway ventures.“What I would give for the economy to be where it was a few years ago,” said Maria Souza Santos, 43, a hairdresser who recently lost her job at a salon in the beachfront district of Copacabana here after sales plummeted about 40 percent in the space of a few months. She said she was trying to make ends meet by cutting the hair of clients in their homes. “I’m struggling,” said Ms. Souza Santos, “but so many people are in the same situation.”With the unemployment rate rising to 8.9 percent in the third quarter from 6.8 percent in the same period last year, economists are quarreling over whether the austerity policies Ms. Rousseff and her finance minister, Joaquim Levy, have been able to carry out despite Congress are making the downturn even more painful.While low commodities prices are curbing economic growth around Latin America, Brazil ranks among the region’s worst-performing economies. Officials are now trying to gradually unwind policies in which they used a web of giant state banks and public energy companies to promote economic growth.“Nothing turned out well,” Míriam Leitão, one of Brazil’s most prominent economic commentators, said Tuesday in an assessment of the fiscal adjustment Ms. Rousseff has pursued after narrowly winning re-election last year. Indeed, the statistics agency showed steep declines in consumer spending, exports, agricultural output and industrial production in the third quarter.On the bright side, some economists noted that Brazil’s economy remained on relatively stronger footing than in periods preceding a radical restructuring of the economy in the 1990s. Before then, hyperinflation ravaged consumers as the country limped from one stabilization plan to the next. “Brazil is facing a very complicated situation, but we are not expecting a solvency crisis,” said Alessandra Ribeiro, an economist at Tendências, a consulting firm in São Paulo.Ms. Ribeiro pointed out that the central bank maintained more than $360 billion in reserves and that the public debt was largely held domestically, potentially giving the authorities the option of printing money to pay creditors in Brazil.Still, the contemplation of such possibilities offers little solace to Brazilians as the economic crisis takes its toll. The spectacle of the police arresting powerful figures has reinforced the view among many that Brazil’s leaders squandered the nation’s good fortune.“I’m facing the possibility of going back to square one,” said Suelen Barca de Souza Cabral, 29, who in September lost her job issuing car insurance policies in Guarulhos, a city in the metropolitan São Paulo area. She said she was at risk of falling behind on mortgage payments, raising her fears about losing her apartment.“The government should have seen this crisis coming, and prepared better for it,” she said."

Turkey agreed to let the United States use an air base near Syria to carry out strikes against the Islamic State. News of the decision arrived alongside reports of an attack on Turkish forces at the border, and after a suicide bombing that killed 27. Both incidents were apparently traced to ISIS.2. In Iraq, an unexpected visit by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter coincided with the deployment of 3,000 American-trained Iraqi troops to retake Ramadi from the Islamic State. The pivotal western city was seized in May.3. An autopsy of Sandra Bland showed injuries consistent with suicide and no evidence that someone else killed her in her Texas jail cell. The Waller County sheriff’s office has said Ms. Bland hanged herself with a trash bag, but her family insists she was in good mental health.4. Donald Trump emphasized the “danger” to himself as he headed to the U.S.-Mexico border near Laredo, Tex. Mr. Trump’s inflammatory comments last month about immigrants from Mexico have served both as a focus for his critics and a rallying point for his fans.5. “Holy cow, what a quarter.” So said an investor who follows Amazon, which reported much better than expected earnings, with a profit of 19 cents per share. The company’s stock shot up in after-hours trading.6. Pearson’s shares are up 1.17 percent after Nikkei, a Japanese media group, agreed to buy The Financial Times newspaper for $1.3 billion. The Dow fell 119 points, or 0.67 percent, and the S.&P. 500 was down 12 points, or 0.57 percent.7. Secretary of State John Kerry urged senators to accept provisions of the recent deal with Iran that would limit its nuclear production. Republican senators who don’t believe the agreement goes far enough accused Mr. Kerry of having been “fleeced” and “bamboozled.”8. President Obama made a surprise appearance at an event for underprivileged students before heading to Kenya, his father’s homeland. He avoided Africa for much of his time in the White House because of its ties to speculation about his citizenship.9. For the least sick end-stage cancer patients, last-ditch chemotherapy made things worse, said a study published today. Newer drugs are more targeted and have fewer side effects, an oncologist noted.10. Scientists are a step closer to locating Earth 2.0. Astronomers associated with Kepler, NASA’s planet-hunting spacecraft, say they spotted what may be the most Earth-like body yet. It circles a star in a 385-day orbit, has lukewarm temperatures and may have a rocky surface.11. There was a U.F.O. involved in this video, but it’s a drone, which shot the footage of crop circles in a Russian field. Enthusiasts of the paranormal say the same pattern appeared there 10 years ago today.Michael Owen contributed reporting. Video produced by Quyn Do.

She was 86.The cause was cancer, said Stephen T. Marshall, her cousin and closest surviving relative.After the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in late 1979, Ms. Klass became a leading advocate of American military support for Afghan insurgents, who sought to topple a Soviet-installed government in Kabul. As the war dragged on, she repeatedly prodded the public not to forget the toll it was taking on civilians there — a million or more casualties by the time the Soviets completed their withdrawal in 1989.“Afghans are wonderfully hospitable to foreigners — but not to would-be conquerors, whom they will fight to the death,” she wrote in 1980 in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times. “Since Islam is the unifying factor among the various ethnic groups, they are fighting under its banner.”She proved correct. The rebels united, ejected the Soviets and spawned the Taliban and their alliances with Muslim extremists.In the early 1950s, Ms. Klass taught English in rural Afghan schools with her husband, William K. Archer — she was one of the first Western women to do so. Later, she wrote an acclaimed travel memoir, “Land of the High Flags,” which was published in 1964 and reissued in 2007 with the subtitle “Afghanistan When the Going Was Good.”“Here, sky and earth seemed enemies glaring bitterly at one another, locked in a dogged struggle,” she wrote, until finally at dusk “the air was softened, as though the heat itself lay panting with exhaustion.”Reviewing the book in The New York Times in 1964, Harrison E. Salisbury wrote, “By what sorcery is a girl wafted from the fat corn-and-hog lands of Iowa, over the very roofs of the world into Kabul, capital of the land of the high flags, there by a species of alchemy to transmute her fresh, fragile sensations into poetic prose that captures the very essence of the brave, proud people of Afghanistan?”In 1988 Ms. Klass edited “Afghanistan: The Great Game Revisited,” a collection of essays that the historian Daniel Pipes described as “a work of clear vision and great importance.”Rosanne Traxler Klass was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on March 29, 1929, to Raymond Klass, a lawyer, and the former Ann Traxler. Her brother, Philip, was a well-known debunker of U.F.O. sightings.She received a bachelor’s degree in literature from the University of Wisconsin and a master’s from Hunter College in New York. Her marriage to Mr. Archer ended in divorce.Her first job in New York was as an assistant to a concert publicist whose clients included the publicity-shy violinist Jascha Heifetz. She also taught in New York public schools and worked for a Persian art scholar.After working for The Times in the 1970s, she became director of the Afghanistan Information Center at Freedom House, a human rights watchdog group in New York, and a founder of the Afghanistan Relief Committee, formed after the Soviet invasion.In a 2013 online interview, Ms. Klass recalled her evolution from a Roosevelt and Kennedy Democrat (her father took her to see President Franklin D. Roosevelt at an Iowa whistle-stop) to a Republican who annoyed her liberal neighbors on the Upper West Side of Manhattan by sporting Ronald Reagan and George Bush campaign buttons."
54a56e9b38f0d83a07dc7c02,"Abandoning Doubt in Sedona, Arizona  ",2015-01-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/travel/abandoning-doubt-in-sedona-arizona-.html,,"While the idea of renewing your vows on a tropical beach at sunset like a pair of histrionic telenovela stars may sound romantic to some, my husband, Sacha, and I found the idea of celebrating our anniversary that way, well, boring.But we are not the most traditional couple. Five years ago, we surprised several dozen guests at our Upper Manhattan apartment by getting married at what we told our friends and family was an engagement party. Paying tribute to the 1980s hip-hop culture that reared us, we improvised, or free-styled, our vows in the form of searing one-liners that were padded with sincere toasts about love, friendship and devotion. Needless to say it was sublimely intimate, a small victory in a world where social networking made maintaining the element of surprise a near mission impossible.It was in this spirit of spontaneity, adventure and mostly curiosity that we decided one evening, after coming across a rerun of one of our guilty pleasures, “Ancient Aliens” on the History Channel, while channel surfing, how we would mark the 11th year (we dated for six before getting hitched) of our own cosmic journey together. In the moments after an animated talking head with a tousled mane said something about an indigenous petroglyph seeming to depict intergalactic travel, it occurred to us: We should go on an alien adventure.Now, before you dismiss us as a couple of conspiracy-minded, ham-radio-listening extremists, let me explain why this went from something you nervously giggle about during the commercial break to a course of action. We had recently spoken about wanting to spend more time traveling within the United States, especially in the ostensibly quixotic Southwest. And I knew from researching the region and from indigenous-American folklore that Arizona was considered by many to be an ethereal place, a spiritual vortex if you will. We would be exploring the world beyond our perception — terrestrial and astral — but essentially discarding cynicism to focus on a belief system that sounds as fantastic as the idea that soul mates actually exist. Not a bad way to mark an anniversary.It took only a few minutes online to find just the right thing: a Sedona U.F.O. Night Vision Sky Tour. The 90-minute excursion was hosted by Kim Carlsberg, a photographer, author and internationally acclaimed U.F.O. researcher and self-professed “contactee.” I immediately emailed Ms. Carls­berg and didn’t wait for a response about her availability on the requested October date before setting the plan in motion for our weekend trip. Something told me things would fall into place.­As we made our way from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to Sedona on State Route 179 with our 2-year-old son, Marceau, and daughter Djali, 17, in the back seat, it felt as if nature coiled herself around our rental. The route, also known as the Red Rock Scenic Byway, was lined on each side by formations that seemed magical. If I hadn’t been so keen on looking for any traces of something, anything, I couldn’t identify as earthly through the translucent clouds, I would have fixated on the red masses around us until they began morphing into giant totems.Optimism and a spirit of inquiry fueled this trip: Sacha and I have never seen — or even looked for — a U.F.O. hovering above our apartment building in New York City, where light pollution and Godzilla-size cranes block out all but the brightest stars.But U.F.O.s are an article of faith in Phoenix. Thousands of people from all walks of life in the city and others in Sonora, Mexico, claim to have witnessed something on March 13, 1997. That something has come to be known as the Phoenix Lights. The eyewitnesses included doctors, a local councilwoman and, eventually, Fife Symington, then the governor, who initially mocked his constituents about the sighting, only to apologize a decade later. Mr. Symington finally admitted to seeing, as he wrote in an article for CNN.com in 2007, “something that defied logic and challenged my reality.” The Air National Guard has since said that the lights were flares from an exercise at a nearby base, but that hasn’t changed everyone’s mind.Arizonans are hardly the only folks in America who believe that we aren’t alone in the universe. According to a 2012 National Geographic poll, 36 percent of Americans believe aliens have visited earth. Sacha and I would consider ourselves open to the idea simply because assuming that humans are absolutely alone in the universe, well, smacks of hubris.The closer we got to our destination, the more energized and open I became. Maybe it was the altitude playing tricks on me (Sedona is 4,500 feet above sea level), but as we rolled into the city I felt as if the red rocks formed a welcoming embrace. The breathtaking scenery, at least from where we stood, rivaled the majesty of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco.Our hotel was in Uptown Sedona, the local equivalent of Woodstock in New York, but this version was teeming with souvenir shops and people hawking indigenous products and spiritual services.During our drive, I had missed a phone call from Ms. Carlsberg, who wanted us to arrive at her headquarters earlier than planned so that she could school us on a few things before our journey into the desert. Sacha and I were stoked. Djali was not. “If they do exist,” she said, looking out the window into the sky, “I’m not sure I want to know.”­The U.F.O. Vortex Tours office was seven minutes away in West Sedona, tucked inside what looked like a single-story home a few feet from a Super 8. The exterior looked as if it could have doubled as a set for “The X-Files.” Sacha and I parked and waited in the car for our host, who was running late, to arrive. “I bet that weird guy is waiting for her, too,” Sacha said, pointing in the direction of a 30-something man sitting on a ledge looking somewhat distressed.I walked up to him and introduced myself. “I’m glad you guys showed up,” he said. “I’ve been sitting here for a while waiting and waiting, and was beginning to think I made this trip for nothing.”The man, who told us he was a landscaper from California named Jude — the Roman Catholic patron saint of desperate causes — was a believer. He wanted to see, was determined to see, something. Ms. Carlsberg’s brochure guaranteed we would, in capital letters: “We always see U.F.O.s!”This guy, I told Sacha, was going to make our jaunt all the more memorable. Just as our new friend started educating us about the vast array of extraterrestrial races, Ms. Carlsberg showed up carrying a bag of equipment and ushered us inside her modest headquarters. It looked more like a living room than an office, with a comfortable couch and the books Ms. Carlsberg wrote, one about her experiences as an abductee and an illustrated collection of edited stories about other people’s galactic encounters, scattered on a coffee table.We watched Ms. Carlsberg, a handsome blond woman, as she took out several pairs of military-grade night-vision goggles from her gear bag and delivered an abridged version of her biography in a straightforward manner. She summarized a fascinating account of how in 1988 her sudden relationship with nonhuman entities began, a narrative she delivered in a no-nonsense manner that suggested she thought she had already won us over. It happened after a long day working on the set of “Baywatch” as the exclusive on-set photographer, she said. A large craft was hovering above the horizon of the Malibu beachfront home she shared with her then-boyfriend, Greg. (We’d have to buy a copy of her book, “Beyond My Wildest Dreams: Diary of a U.F.O. Abductee,” she said, for further details.)“O.K., so enough about me, what brought you here?” Ms. Carlsberg asked abruptly, “but keep it short so we can share our experiences more in detail out there.” Sacha and I said only that we were open to the idea that extraterrestrials existed. Jude, whose demeanor brought to mind Kurt Vonnegut’s eccentric character Billy Pilgrim, went off on a tangent. Ms.Carlsberg had to cut him off after a minute or so. “Hold onto that story so we can leave here in time,” she said.After a tutorial on the night vision goggles — we would be able to see more than 70,000 times clearer than the naked eye — and instructions on alerting one another anytime we spotted something in the sky, Ms. Carlsberg got to the most important bit of guidance: how not to confuse other things with a U.F.O. In addition to airplane lights, which flash red and white and appear at a relatively low altitude, there would be shooting stars, planets, satellites and birds, and depending on the clarity, maybe we would spot the Milky Way galaxy and its neighbor, Andromeda. (Under no circumstances, “are you to point the laser in the direction of a plane or each other,” she said, referring to the pointer, which she carefully guarded). What was a surefire sign that what we had succeeded in spotting was an alien spacecraft? The light emanating from within the vessel, usually shaped like an orb, triangle or tube: It pulsates.Minutes later, we were in a pitch-black expanse helping Ms. Carlsberg unload plastic folding chairs, bags with gear and a small boombox that played a new age score that Sacha and I could have done without. Looking upward at the sky through the night vision goggles was spectacular and in itself worth the $90-per-person fee. Before Ms. Carlsberg was able to slip on her goggles, our U.F.O.-enthusiast spotted something that turned out to be a shooting star. Ms. Carlsberg pointed out constellations. Sacha and I said little, standing close to each other and peering up at what looked like an inverted highway. And then we started seeing things that we simply couldn’t explain.“Look up here!” Sacha shouted, taking the laser from Ms. Carlsberg and flashing it in a direction where two objects were pulsating a bright light. Sacha laughed as I watched, dumbstruck by the two objects that floated above us to join two other dimmer ones, ultimately forming a square. As they floated away together like a group of synchronized swimmers, Ms. Carlsberg shouted up into the sky, “Woo-hoo!”Minutes later, I spotted a large object pulsating brightly like a heartbeat in the distance, gliding quietly through the sky. The light made it look like a round cotton ball. “What in the —!” I yelled. We were told to quickly remove our goggles. When I flashed the laser in its direction, the object — it was not an airplane, or satellite, a bird or a huge drone — dimmed its lights and shot up through the sky before it started brightly pulsating again, then floating away. We all studied the object quietly as Ms. Carlsberg, fired up by the sighting, gave us a spirited explanation about the differences between the larger, more conservative objects, the “mothers,” and their smaller and sometimes more playful counterparts, or “teenagers.” The smaller ones, she said, sometimes responded by flashing their lights.There would be plenty of time to second-guess what we were seeing. But not that night, when we were swept up in the sense of euphoria that came with abandoning doubt. In approximately two hours, we counted about 40 unidentifiable things flying high above us. We never checked with the military to see if there was an explanation because that would have seemed a surrender to skepticism.There we were, just four of us there, necks craned, hoping to catch a glimpse of what might lie beyond our planet in this vast world. You had to open yourself to the ludicrous, be a fool, so to speak, to have faith, in life and in love.When it came time to pack up and go, Ms. Carlsberg thanked whatever it was that we saw, or thought we saw, for making the cameos."
5603515438f0d84a40af51cc,"Phil Patton, Design Writer Who Scrutinized the Everyday, Dies at 63",2015-09-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/business/phil-patton-scrutinizer-of-the-mundane-is-dead-at-63.html,The New York Times,"Phil Patton, a prolific writer on design and technology who saw the deeper cultural messages in subjects as varied as the interstate highway system, Air Jordan sneakers, tire treads and Mountain Dew’s Mega Mouth Slam Can, died on Tuesday in Wayne, N.J. He was 63.The cause was complications of emphysema, his wife, Kathleen Hamilton, said.Mr. Patton’s keen eye for objects and their hidden significance made him a highly sought-after contributor for a host of magazines, including Art in America, Esquire, Smithsonian, Architectural Digest and Wired.For many years he wrote on design for the Home section of The New York Times, where he originated the Public Eye column in the late 1990s, and The New York Times Magazine. In recent years he contributed to the paper’s Automobile section and wrote for its Wheels blog.Although best known for his writing on product design, especially the design of cars, Mr. Patton could turn almost anything to account. His first book, “Razzle-Dazzle: The Curious Marriage of Television and Professional Football” (1984), described the way television affected the style of play and the business of the N.F.L. An abiding fascination with cars and highways led to “Open Road: A Celebration of the American Highway” (1986), and in “Made in U.S.A.: The Secret Histories of the Things That Made America” (1992), he examined common objects with the eye of a connoisseur and the mind of a cultural critic.“He was an old-fashioned intellectual, curious about everything,” the architecture and design historian Christopher W. Mount said in a telephone interview. “He wrote a famous article about the tops of takeout coffee cups, how the indentations work. It sounds small, but he would expand these things and make them pertinent to the wider world.”He did it with great flair. The Oakley Time Bomb watch, he wrote, “is a combination of Rube Goldberg and H. R. Giger, designer of sets for films like ‘Alien,’ with a dose of Groucho Marx’s Professor Flywheel thrown in.”He made short work of a toothbrush holder described by its makers as “pearlescent,” which, he wrote, was “not to be confused with pearl or even mother-of-pearl; think of it, maybe, as mother-in-law of pearl.”Lewis Foster Patton was born on March 23, 1952, in Durham, N.C. His father, Lewis, was an Air Force gunner left blind and badly wounded in a bombing raid over Japan during World War II. A few months after Lewis Sr.’s son was born, the crew member who had saved the father’s life died. In his honor, Lewis Sr. passed the man’s name, Phil, on to his son.Mr. Patton attended Harvard, where he was the arts editor of The Crimson and earned a bachelor’s degree in English and history in 1974. He graduated from Columbia University in 1975 with a master’s degree in comparative literature; he wrote his thesis on Vladimir Nabokov.He worked briefly as a fact-checker for Esquire and as the editor of Delta’s in-flight magazine. But he had already begun contributing articles on art and design to a variety of publications while still in college, and he soon gave up steady employment for freelance work.In the mid-1980s, Mr. Patton underwent a kind of conversion, becoming more skeptical about European design and more appreciative of homegrown products. Calling himself “a recovering modernist,” he told New York magazine that “suddenly, the Art Deco spires of the Chrysler Building started to look a whole lot better than the steel-and-glass outlines of the Lever House.”Mr. Patton, who taught in the design criticism program at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, helped develop many museum shows, as either a curator or a consultant, notably “Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century” at the Museum of Modern Art in 1999, “On the Job: Design and the American Office” at the National Building Museum in Washington in 2001, and “Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design” at the Phoenix Art Museum in 2007. With Donald Albrecht, he was the curator of “Cars, Culture and the City” at the Museum of the City of New York in 2010. Mr. Patton lived in Woodland Park, N.J. His first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Caroline Patton, and a son, Andrew. His other books include “Dreamland: Travels Inside the Secret World of Roswell and Area 51” (1998), about the subculture of U.F.O. watchers; “Bug: The Strange Mutations of the World’s Most Famous Automobile” (2002); and “Michael Graves Designs: The Art of the Everyday Object” (2004).Serendipity often ruled Mr. Patton’s choice of subjects. He became interested in coffee-cup lids, for example, because they piled up around him in his car. “Gathering them up one day in an unaccustomed fit of neatness,” he wrote in his design blog in 2011, “I noticed how many varieties there were, and how complex the combination of instructions and indications on them, how various and intricate the devices for opening and locking back flaps — in short, how intensely designed they were.”Trivial? Not at all. “Coffee lids,” he continued, “show the whole vast machinery of modern culture.”"
56a16f6538f0d83189a62cdb,"As ‘The X-Files’ Returns, Do We Still Want to Believe?",2016-01-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/arts/television/tv-review-x-files-miniseries.html,The New York Times,"IN 2002, after 202 episodes of government conspiracies, bright lights in the sky, black oil, creepy monsters and sexual tension, “The X-Files” said goodbye. On Sunday on Fox, the F.B.I. agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) return for a six-part mini-series.The New York Times TV critics James Poniewozik and Mike Hale emailed over encrypted lines from undisclosed locations to discuss the new series and the legacy of the original.James Poniewozik For nine seasons (and two movies) “The X-Files” kept fans waiting for answers. You and I don’t need to. We’ve seen three of the six episodes, and people want the truth first: Are they any good?Not at first, not at all. The first episode is called “My Struggle,” which aptly describes the experience of sitting through it. It lumbers. It plods. The actors chew sawdusty mouthfuls of expository dialogue. It introduces an Alex-Jones-like conspiracy-talk-show host (Joel McHale), who’s meant to be played straight but comes off like parody. Above all, it’s handicapped by the fact that it has to tear down much of the show’s mythology and construct a new one in an hour. It’s like rebuilding a sports car just to back it down the driveway.Thankfully, the second episode shakes the dourness and gives Mulder and Scully more room to breathe. But it’s the third — a comic palate-cleanser in the “monster of the week” vein — that finally recreates the show’s oddball delights. As Scully says, in one of the script’s many meta comments, “I forgot how much fun these cases could be.” She’s right. Still, while “The X-Files” has a great legacy — on serial TV, on sci-fi and, thematically, on television at large — I wonder if its time has passed. Has the show changed, or have we?Mike Hale Man, that first episode is a dud. You can understand the need to recapitulate, but not in such a flat-footed way. It’s like a greatest-hits reel — the phone call from Skinner, the shadowy warehouse, the abductee living in fear on a lonely road — with all the tension and excitement edited out.To your question: “The X-Files” was a show about a certain mode of fear and style of conspiracy, and in the 14 years since it ended our culture has been overtaken by a new, more grim, more literal sense of fear. (The last season started on Nov. 11, 2001.) In the opening episode, the extended U.F.O. history lesson feels like a wrongheaded attempt to explain what all the excitement used to be about. In the exponentially better second and third episodes, the writers mostly ignore the time lapse, except to poke fun at Mulder’s incompetence with personal electronics. They’re confident that the show’s structure still stands up.And about those writers. The show’s creator, Chris Carter, took on the challenge of the introductory episode, and you have to cut him some slack for that. But his record since 2002 consists of an O.K. film (“The X-Files: I Want to Believe”) and a terrible Amazon pilot (“The After”). Episode 2 was written and directed by James Wong, who co-wrote the original series’s first “monster of the week” episode, the extra creepy “Squeeze.” Episode 3 is by Darin Morgan, whose four scripts for the original show included two of the greats, “Clyde Bruckman’s Final Repose” and “Jose Chung’s ‘From Outer Space.’” So maybe the improvement is no surprise. Looking ahead, we get Glen Morgan, Mr. Wong’s old writing partner, for the fourth episode, but then two Carter scripts to close out the mini-series. So, fingers crossed.As a fan I loved the self-referentiality of the third episode — my favorite line was probably Mulder’s “I’m just looking for some internal logic” — but as a critic I wondered how interesting the episode would be for someone who hadn’t watched the show before. It was really heavy on the in-jokes. Did that bother you at all? Does it matter?Poniewozik From my perspective — I was obsessed back in the day, but have forgotten a ton since — the shout-outs are nice, but not essential. They get a bit much; after each “The truth is out there” and “The truth is in here” and “I want to believe” I half-expected the actors to hold for applause. This is definitely a project for the devout, which raises the question of who those folks are. There are original X-philes, of course, but the show also seems anecdotally to have had a strong afterlife on Netflix.Which is interesting, because there’s something very prebinge about its structure — a ratio of a couple of stand-alone episodes for every mythology episode. That’s very much an artifact of the TV business of the ’90s. Before Netflix, before “Game of Thrones,” before “Breaking Bad” (from Vince Gilligan of “The X-Files”), complicated serial TV was considered a risk. (“Twin Peaks” was an exception, but also a cautionary tale.) Before DVRs and streaming made catching up easier, you might permanently lose viewers every time they missed an episode, so older TV was aimed at making every installment accessible to a brand-new audience. “The X-Files,” appropriately, was a DNA-engineered hybrid. Part of the time it was a complex sci-fi saga. Other times, it was an anthology — part “Twilight Zone,” part buddy-cop show. It contributed to the show’s surreal atmosphere, but I wonder if Mr. Carter would make the same show starting today — if an “X-Files” of 2016 would be “Lost” or “Black Mirror.”Hale As long as you’re raising the mythology versus stand-alone debate, I’ll cast my vote for the stand-alones, though it’s not necessarily a fair fight. When you look back at the show across this many years, it makes sense that the well-made, self-contained stories with distinctive characters or unusual approaches would be the ones to adhere in the memory. I’m pleased that within the tight compass of this six-episode season they found room for at least one true monster-of-the-week episode.Another thing I appreciated about that third episode (titled “Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster”) was that it allowed Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson to be a little silly. Humor, and those actors’ comic talents, were an important ingredient in the mix of the original series that gets overlooked. Mr. Duchovny, especially, is a natural comedian with a genius for self-deprecation. He still gives just the right note of innocent vanity to a line like: “I’m a middle-aged man, Scully. No, I am.” Like you, I’ve forgotten a lot, but it’s my sense that in general, mythology worked against humor — the serialized episodes had a severity to them, a “we’re being serious now” tone.Poniewozik If there are two kinds of “X-Files” fans, I am a committed Mythologist, though the new episodes do have me wondering if the Monsterists were right. With a few exceptions — the milestone “Paper Clip” in Season 3 — the serial episodes aren’t the show’s greatest, individually. But they made it special, and influential: The yarn on every Carrie Mathison conspiracy-bulletin-board-of-crazy leads back to them. It’s hard to recreate that 1990s paranoid magic now simply by grafting on a few Edward Snowden references.When the new episodes work, it’s because Mulder and Scully work. One thing I like about the new stand-alone episodes is that they’re not entirely static; they carry the weight of history between these characters. (Oh yeah, remember that they had a kid together?) Even the lighter third episode reminds us how experience has changed their perspectives. Mulder has been burned enough to be dubious, while Scully has seen enough to be open to the impossible.It’s especially good to see Ms. Anderson, such a beacon of intensity in “The Fall,” get to flex her dry humor again. When she pulls an obscure fact out of thin air, as Scully is wont to do, she shrugs it off in a way that both acknowledges how much time has passed and tells us the important things haven’t changed. “I’m old school, Mulder,” she says. “Pre-Google.”HaleIt all comes back to Mulder and Scully, which is to say Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson. It’s the main reason the mostly Mulder-less final seasons were so flavorless, even though the writing was often at the same level.Many shows have tried to follow the “X-Files” template to one degree or another, but they’re always missing that Mulder-Scully umami. “Fringe” tried to reconstitute it with Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson as an F.B.I. agent and a skeptical civilian. “Supernatural” cut women out of the equation and made the show’s demon hunters two brothers whose devotion was to each other.Chris Carter was reviving a television tradition of science-fiction-inflected horror (or horror-inflected science fiction) that ran from “The Twilight Zone” to “Night Gallery” to “Kolchak: The Night Stalker,” but his and his writers’ great contribution was the addition of flirtatiousness and genuine adult emotion to the mix. The legacy of “The X-Files” may be that it made TV hospitable again to a range of genre shows after the sitcom domination of the 1980s, helping pave the way for future fantasists like J. J. Abrams and Joss Whedon. But when it was at its best, the show was equal parts suspense, horror, science fiction — and romance."

And as they get older, they still make mistakes — maybe not as many, but bigger and more dangerous ones. They rebel. They test their boundaries. They slip around (or smash through) the guardrails their parents have set up for their protection. For Charlie and Simone Gerhardt, the children of criminals, growing up comes with a deep moral confusion and a nefarious sense of duty. Will they be ready to run the family business? (Is that something they even want?) And what sort of twisted values are their elders instilling in them to prepare them for it?The battle for Charlie’s soul has been waged in secret between Bear and Dodd all season, though the boy’s affliction should have Bear believing that God has already ruled in his favor. Charlie seems to have a talent for numbers and his dad wants him to stay in school and figure out nonviolent ways to help the family. (Even Dodd concedes that the Gerhardts could use a lawyer. They have no Robert Duvall.) But shows of masculinity are a constant in the Gerhardt household and Charlie naturally feels that he needs to assert his manhood rather than heed his father’s orders to shrink away from the coming violence. He can shoot with one hand, after all, and that finally earned him Uncle Dodd’s long-sought approval.As for Simone, I had her wrongly pegged as a femme fatale, tricked by early signs that she had control of her sexuality and was playing both sides for sport. She’s never lacked for confidence — her sexual assertiveness with Mike Milligan was proof enough of that — but “The Gift of the Magi” exposes her as more of a garden-variety rebel, using her maturing body as a weapon to lash out at her awful father. Until now, the violence her betrayal might cause has been theoretical, so she’s blindsided and frightened by Mike’s threats in the hotel room. In a blink, she goes from naughty co-conspirator to helpless pawn — not the “Romeo and Juliet” she might have imagined, but the wedge Kansas City needs to break apart the Gerhardt family. Simone has never looked like a child until now.Charlie and Simone’s misadventures in “The Gift of the Magi” are about more than children making mistakes. They also clarify what the next generation of Gerhardts has inherited. Otto made certain his son Dodd could operate in the family business; we saw that in flashback last week, when the young whippersnapper jammed a blade into a gangster’s neck during a Ronald Reagan movie. Dodd would no doubt do likewise if he had a son, but Simone he either abuses or neglects, leaving her to create mischief on the sidelines. Bear at least imagines a more peaceful future for Charlie, but the Gerhardt household doesn’t accommodate weaklings and bookworms. Neither Charlie nor Simone is prepared for the horrors encountered in this episode, and it’s safe to say that neither will ever be prepared to carry the Gerhardts into the late 20th century and beyond. Even without Kansas City trying to set up shop, the family business has no future.Oh look, I’ve buried the lede! Bruce Campbell finally surfaces as Ronald Reagan, and having played Elvis in the cult favorite “Bubba Ho-Tep,” it’s remarkable how little he has to change about himself to slip into both roles. Mr. Campbell’s snake-oil charisma sells Reagan’s stump speech about America as “that shining city on a hill” and the empty conviction with which he tells Lou that Americans can overcome any challenge on God’s green earth. The one challenge Reagan himself couldn’t overcome in either 1980 or 1984? Winning Minnesota, but that doesn’t stop him from coming through a town like Luverne and shoring up Republican support outside Minneapolis/St. Paul.Bringing Reagan into the alien world of “Fargo” is an audacious choice — and a particularly risky one, given how much trouble Season Two has had in infusing late-70s politics and culture into its crime story. But the rhetorical battle between Jimmy Carter’s sober “malaise” moment and Reagan’s relentless optimism settles strangely on Luverne, as many political speeches do to ordinary people. Maybe they live in the America Carter describes and want to live in Reagan’s, as the standing ovation for the latter might indicate. Yet there’s also a degree to which the words of neither man apply, beyond serving as a barometer for how people are feeling (or wish to feel). Lou wants Reagan to deliver him to a more hopeful place, but the Gipper slips away before saying how. No matter who’s president, the people of Luverne are on their own. As Ed Blumquist tells Peggy, “We’ll figure it out. It’s what people do.”Still, the Blumquists can’t seem to get on the same page, as indicated by the episode title. Peggy remains the show’s toughest puzzle to solve, perhaps because even she doesn’t know what she wants. Though she shuffled Lou out the door last week, she heard him well enough to resolve to get out of town, which seems to suit her just fine, since she’s been yearning for some kind of change. Her impulsive decision to sell the car and stick things out with Ed is the first time she’s shown commitment to their marriage, but the timing is cruel, since Ed has just killed one or two more people and lost the butcher shop in a fire, and he wants them to split immediately. The two are at cross-purposes again in this desperate moment, with Ed forced to hold back all this shocking information while Peggy, oblivious to the blood spattered on his shirt, enthuses about selling the car, buying the shop and putting their roots down in Luverne, just like he wanted.“That’s great,” Ed says. “Thank you. But we gotta go.”• The wounded children theme of this week’s episode carries through even to Dodd, who’s about as skilled at lying to his mother as a 6-year-old. Now Floyd is supposed to believe that Rye was killed not by a butcher from Luverne, but by the “Butcher of Luverne,” a contract man out of Kansas City. Expect the lie about who really killed Rye to unravel in short order.• The gunfight in the woods is a terrific piece of staging, however questionable the plan to ambush the K.C. crew when they’re at their most heavily armed. Joe Bulo looks strikingly out of his element. He’s a pragmatist and negotiator, not a heavy — fearsome in the boardroom, but easy pickings for Hanzee.• More greatness from Nick Offerman on the Reagan tour: “I’m not shaking his hand. The man made a movie with a monkey. It wouldn’t be dignified.” (He then, of course, shakes Reagan’s hand and praises “Cattle Queen of Montana,” which is the greater indignity.)• A fun “Fargo” Easter egg: The song that’s playing when Peggy picks up the car is “Let’s Find Each Other Tonight” by José Feliciano, which Feliciano performs the night Steve Buscemi’s character in the film steps out with a call girl. “José Feliciano, you got no complaints.”• U.F.O. sighting: Betsy Solverson notices one hovering over a family scene that young Molly has sketched in crayon. Curious, that."

A character grabs a carving knife at one point, and, you guessed it, there are young people imperiled in a cabin in the woods.College students — played by Freddie Stroma (the handsome one), Jesse Moss (the unstable one), Melanie Papalia (the pill-popping one) and Anja Savcic (the dim one) — head to the family country retreat of the sensible April (Brittany Allen) for a weekend of fun and partying, only to discover a crash-landing U.F.O.Each violently encounters the aforementioned visitors, who make entrances with a tremendous ruckus before absconding with their prey to another spaceship, hovering in the sky. (Its interior evokes “The Matrix,” with a soupçon of “Alien.”)Underlying this overlong and overheated enterprise is a surfeit of ambition. Maybe too much: Its screenwriters, the Vicious Brothers — comprising Colin Minihan, the director, and Stuart Ortiz — had wanted to make “Extraterrestrial” for years but instead opted for the low-budget indie “Grave Encounters,” a video-on-demand hit. “Extraterrestrial” feels like a wish-fulfillment project; perhaps less self-indulgence was in order."
561199c738f0d86550b96560,"Jim Shaw, From Trash Bins and Swap Meets, a Prodigious Body of Work",2015-10-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/arts/design/jim-shaw-from-trash-bins-and-swap-meets-a-prodigious-body-of-work.html,The New York Times,"ALTADENA, Calif. — The artist Jim Shaw, whose retrospective opens on Wednesday at the New Museum in Manhattan, works in a modest converted house here on the outskirts of Los Angeles amid such a jumble of paintings and drawings it seems as if you could extract at least another three retrospectives out of it.The mess is not exactly Collyer brothers level, but the other afternoon Mr. Shaw had to dig through layers of works in progress to unearth a box with a book he wanted to give to a reporter. The box crowded the furniture in the living room along with two old church organs, his studio manager’s Irish wolfhound and shelves bulging with titles like “Jokes for the John” and “Petroleum Collectibles.”“For a lot of the things that I buy on eBay,” said Mr. Shaw, 63, in the middle of a meandering studio tour, “I’m the only bidder.”The clutter is in keeping with the nature of an artist who has rummaged more thoroughly and strangely than almost any of his generation through the trash bins and swap meets of 20th-century American culture, forging a prodigious body of work that melds his eccentric collections with his comic-Surrealist paintings — and in a way that makes it hard to separate the two. As the critic Christopher Knight has written, Mr. Shaw “debunks the modernist myth of art as keeper of an ultimate, essential truth,” while being “sincerely obsessed with the perfectly human search for spiritual peace.”His career has prowled the vicinities of fringe churches, cults, dangerous political movements, visionary art scenes and failed philosophies — and the ways they try to represent themselves visually and verbally — making him into what might be called an underground artist’s underground artist. (Though he is one who, in keeping with the sort of contradiction he loves, shows at an important New York gallery, Metro Pictures).If you wanted to know more, for example, about the U.F.O. society known as the Unarius Academy of Science, with publications like “The Voice of Orion”; or about Jack Chick’s disturbing religious tracts; or about American Freemasonry; or how the Branch Davidians are related to the Millerites; or about the 1970s extravaganzas of the Rev. O. Lee Jaggers and Miss Velma (married first cousins) at their Universal World Church in Los Angeles, Mr. Shaw is one-stop shopping.The New Museum show, “The End Is Here,” which runs through Jan. 10, will be a kind of reunion tour for a body of work that Mr. Shaw is perhaps best known for, his vast collection of thrift store paintings, which made their first gallery appearance in New York in 1991, in an exhibition that has come to be revered for its unexpected impact on the ways people thought about painting at the time. A selection, from some 400 canvases that were eventually acquired as a group by a Brussels collector, are now back in New York, along with others that Mr. Shaw has collected recently, grouped into categories like “religious paintings” and “the depressed ex-girlfriend section.”“Jim has always been very important and influential to me because of the way he blurs the distinction between insider art and outsider art, which is something I’ve been involved with for a long time,” said Massimiliano Gioni, the New Museum’s associate director and director of exhibitions and the curator of its show, along with Gary Carrion-Murayari and Margot Norton.“I think he is progressively fascinated by forms of visual culture at the moment of their disappearance,” Mr. Gioni added, describing Mr. Shaw’s obsessive collections of amateur art, religious tracts and other cultural castoffs as “an iconographic sanctuary.”Mr. Shaw, who has lived and worked in Los Angeles since the 1970s, grew up in Midland, Mich., the home of Dow Chemical, where his father was a product designer. Along with the artist Mike Kelley, a fellow student at the University of Michigan, Mr. Shaw was a founder of the short-lived but influential punk-noise band Destroy All Monsters. And along with Mr. Kelley and Paul McCarthy, another Los Angeles transplant from further east, Mr. Shaw became known in the 1980s and 1990s for a creepy brand of art – sometimes identified under the catchall term “abject” — that took a good, hard look at the hairy underbelly of the American dream.Mr. Shaw’s work in particular, Mr. Gioni said, holds tight, without irony or condescension, to “forms of visual culture that would otherwise go away — and indirectly what he collects and shows becomes a commentary on what a museum is, who gets to preserve these stories and cultures and how they get shown.”While Mr. Kelley, who died in 2012, and Mr. McCarthy became highly successful in the commercial art world, Mr. Shaw still speaks about his career like a kind of middle manager at an office supply company, mentioning his mortgage and the outrageous costs of education. (Mr. Shaw is married to the artist Marnie Weber and they have a teenage daughter.) While there is some false modesty in this, Mr. Shaw, who worked for years in Hollywood special-effects departments to pay the bills, said he had never really been able to adjust the calculus of his artistic obsessions to the art world’s desires.“I just came to the conclusion that if I tried to make things for the market, it was never going to work,” he said during the studio walk-through, wearing badly stained khakis, a turquoise Hawaiian shirt and a pair of reading glasses on his nose in front of his regular glasses. Showing off a large new painting, almost completed, of a surrealist landscape scattered with jars holding fetuses, he fake-grimaced and said, “I have no idea who’s going to want to buy that.”In some ways, Mr. Shaw’s career has suffered under the shadow of Mr. Kelley’s, a close friend with whom he shared many interests — comic book characters, underground cultures, vernacular traditions twisted by Pop culture. But with the retrospective, and a huge show of his work that opened in March and also closes in January at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Mr. Shaw is getting the kind of attention that his work, which has been followed for many years in Europe, has never had in the United States.It’s not easy, through his bone-dry, unassuming demeanor, to tell quite how he feels about that. But last week, back in New York to help hang the show, he looked up admiringly at large, kooky religious banners — ones he came across years ago at the Pasadena City College flea market — hanging prominently in the middle of the museum’s third floor. One banner’s hand-painted message seemed to comically invoke Mr. Shaw’s quasi-religious career itself: “Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth.”Mr. Shaw looked around and shook his head. “There’s so much more that could be in here, you know,” he said."

5639d72e38f0d8786b6fe513,The Weaponization of ‘Truther’,2015-11-04,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/magazine/the-weaponization-of-truther.html,The New York Times,"What does it mean to be a ‘‘truther’’?We are all supposedly on journeys to truth. I had a rabbi tell me this once. And to be an agent of truth — a truth-­teller — is a noble thing. We praise journalists, gadflies, investigators or even politicians that speak ‘‘truth to power’’ and tell ‘‘hard truths’’ and unearth the ‘‘inconvenient truths’’ that defy official narratives and alter our destinies.But it is not flattering to be called a ‘‘truther.’’ The term originated, as far as anyone can tell, to characterize people who embraced alternative explanations for the Sept. 11 attacks. In 2006, The New York Times published an article about a convention in Chicago — dubbed the ‘‘International Education and Strategy Conference for 9/11 Truth’’ — in which alternative theories about the terrorist attacks were discussed. The report, by Alan Feuer, included a neutral description of 9/11 truthers, whom he characterized as a group with a ‘‘rank and file’’ that included ‘‘professors, chain-saw operators, mothers, engineers, activists, used-­book sellers, pizza deliverymen, college students, a former fringe candidatefor United States Senate and a long­haired fellow named hummux (pronounced ‘who-­mook’) who, on and off, lived in a cave for 15 years.’’A truther stereotype was born — and mutated. Today, anyone who subscribes to or perpetuates less-­mainstream or in some cases deeply offensive versions of accepted scenarios becomes susceptible to the dreaded ‘‘er’’ suffix. Add ‘‘er,’’ dismiss as nuts (rinse and retweet). It suggests a position on the fringe in the same way that, say, adding ‘‘gate’’ signifies a scandal. So why is it good to tell the truth but bad to be a truther?Consider a recent object lesson of supposed trutherism. It occurred a few weeks ago in the Republican presidential campaign — and of course involves Donald, the Trumper. ‘‘When you talk about George Bush,’’ the then-­maybe-­front-­runner said of the 43rd president during an interview on Bloomberg TV, ‘‘I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time.’’‘‘Hold on,’’ the Bloomberg anchorwoman Stephanie Ruhle said. ‘‘You can’t blame George Bush for that.’’And why not? ‘‘He was president, O.K.?’’ Trump countered. ‘‘Blame him or don’t blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign.’’In a technical sense, Trump had truth on his side. George W. Bush was, in fact, the president on Sept. 11, 2001. (As an aside, I was struck by Trump’s curiously authoritarian use of ‘‘reign’’ to describe the tenure of an American president.) Trump did not explicitly assign blame to Bush, or say whether he could have done anything to prevent the attacks. But by raising the matter of blame, Trump was defying yet another truth that Republicans had until that point held to be self-­evident: that W. held no culpability for anything that happened on 9/11.There was an often-­cited warning in the President’s Daily Brief from August 2001 cautioning that Osama bin Laden was ‘‘determined to strike in U.S.’’ But the general inclination, at least among Republicans, has been to cut Bush slack on this and credit him with ‘‘keeping America safe.’’ Trump’s remark had Bush’s defenders firing up their umbrage machines. ‘‘How pathetic for @realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 9/11,’’ Jeb Bush tweeted. ‘‘We were attacked & my brother kept us safe.’’ Ari Fleischer, a Bush White House press secretary, took it further, breaking out the heavy er-­tillery, telling CNN: ‘‘When Trump implies that since 9/11 took place on Bush’s watch he is partially responsible for it, he’s starting to sound like a truther,’’ he said. ‘‘And after all, does Donald Trump also think since Pearl Harbor happened on F.D.R.’s watch that F.D.R. is responsible?’’Trump has always been more associated with ‘‘birthers’’ than ‘‘truthers.’’ ‘‘Birther,’’ of course, is the common ‘‘er’’ reserved for those who believe that President Obama’s birth certificate might be fake, that he was born outside the United States and that his presidency is therefore not legitimate. Trump was a vocal proponent of this view in the 2012 presidential campaign, which he made many loud noises about joining but ultimately did not. His apparent fixation on the cause was enough for many to consign him to the nativist fringe of the Republican Party, or so it seemed. It also contributed enough doubt that it compelled Obama to actually release his long-­form birth certificate at a White House news conference in 2011.Trump has largely avoided discussing the Obama birth-­certificate issue in this campaign. He is an avowed non­fan of the word ‘‘birther,’’ which he told Politico in 2012 was ‘‘a derogatory term, created by a certain group in the media’’ (he instead called it Obama’s ‘‘place-­of-­birth issue’’). But to this point, trutherism in its original 9/11 sense has never really been Trump’s thing. Fleischer told me that he intentionally used the word ‘‘truther’’ as an epithet. In a sense, he was counterpunching in a classically Trumpian style — floating a notion and letting it hang there to absorb sinister connotations. Trump ‘‘did what people who want to hang dirty innuendos do, which is Donald Trump style,’’ Fleischer said. ‘‘He made the allegation that Bush was somehow to blame, without saying how or why.’’ Fleischer said that Trump did a similar thing recently when he brought up Ben Carson’s Seventh-­day Adventist faith and discussed it in a way that suggested he was confused. ‘‘I just don’t know’’ about Seventh-­day Adventists, Trump said, leaving an information vacuum for sinister thoughts to flourish.Trump, Fleischer said, was inviting listeners to conflate legitimate questions of Bush’s handling of pre-9/11 intelligence with more easily dismissed (or screwball) notions. ‘‘I’m not going to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt about anything he leaves unsaid,’’ he told me. Fleischer is unaligned in the Republican primary race and says he is not a truther or a birther or any kind of ‘‘er’’ except for a ‘‘Fleischer’’ — which he says could refer to someone (like himself) who does not believe recent studies equating the consumption of certain red meats with an increased risk of cancer. ‘‘I don’t buy the bacon stories,’’ Fleischer said. ‘‘That means I’m a Fleischer.’’ Or a ‘‘Flesher.’’It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when ‘‘truther’’ became so readily weaponized. In debates about previous conspiracy theories, no one used terms like, say, ‘‘Kennedy assassination truther.’’ No one dismissed as ‘‘Elvis truthers’’ those who believed that Elvis Presley remained alive. A recent Rawstory.com headline identified Rage Against the Machine’s bassist, Tim Commerford, as a ‘‘moon-­landing truther,’’ although no one would have used such a term at the time of the actual — or alleged — moon landing.But after that 2006 Times article, truthers were suddenly everywhere. Subsequent reports — in The Washington Post, Vanity Fair and U.S. News & World Report — all made reference to 9/11 ‘‘truthers,’’ although it took a while for the word to acquire its full-on wacko connotation. In recent years, ‘‘truther’’ has come to have its own totally discrete constellation of evolving meanings and history. Social media, as it tends to do, has accelerated the process.After NASA recently reported that scientists had found signs of water on Mars, some skeptics dismissed the news as concocted, in the words of Rush Limbaugh, to ‘‘help advance their left-wing agenda on this planet.’’ Newsweek presented these counterarguments under the headline ‘‘Mars Conspiracy ‘Truthers’ React to NASA’s Water Announcement.’’ Vice recently profiled a ‘‘drought truther’’ who maintained that the catastrophic lack of rain in California was caused by ‘‘a secret weather-­control operation orchestrated by the Powers That Be, part of a doomed attempt by government geoengineers to stop global warming.’’ ‘‘Stevie Wonder truthers’’ have questioned whether the singer is in fact blind or is just faking it (for some reason). The foremost Wonder truther, Bomani Jones of ESPN, cited as evidence a guy who claimed to have sold Wonder three TVs. Jones later acknowledged to me, in an interview for this magazine, that his Wonder trutherism was ‘‘a somewhat inappropriate joke that has taken on a life of its own.’’You can’t help wondering how many sectors of trutherism begin similarly — goofs that spin out of control, to a point at which they are taken quasi-­seriously. The Internet is a supercollider of alternative interpretations — if not realities — and the people who embrace them. People then marginalize those views by calling perpetrators truthers. Things can get very pitched in short order. Every topic — Benghazi, droughts and Mars — becomes a potential battlefield between information and misinformation, truth and truthers.Trutherism can quickly become stranger than fiction, whatever is which. It becomes a thing, if not a meme. Our individual journeys to truth play out via search engine. You long for a less-­networked, less­-noisy and less-­dismissive community of believers versus skeptics. Or at least I do. Is it me or did conspiracy theorizing and mythmaking used to be so much more fun? I miss the Sasquatch and Area 51 people. ‘‘The truth is out there,’’ as the U.F.O. buffs used to say. And they used to be ‘‘buffs,’’ not ‘‘truthers,’’ in those days of greater innocence and less dismissiveness, before the truthers were out there, too."
55de326f38f0d87d7f5f1b14,Sidewalk Blackboards Offer Some Chalk ’n’ Chew,2015-08-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/fashion/sidewalk-blackboards-offer-a-little-chalk-n-chew.html,The New York Times,"Phil Ashworth studied illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design. His influences include the “simple graphic lines” of Shel Silverstein and New Yorker cartoonists, and his work has been shown at Gallery Nucleus and Hero Complex Gallery, both in Southern California. He has designed a T-shirt graphic that Vans skateboard shoes is printing and is starting to work on a book proposal.But as a barista at Gimme Coffee in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Mr. Ashworth uses the cafe’s chalkboard as his most frequently chosen medium.Recent references included “The Simpsons,” “Taxi Driver” (“You drinkin’ with me?”), “Jaws,” “The X-Files” (a coffee-cup-and-saucer U.F.O. with “I want to believe”) and “Indiana Jones.”The creative process for him is a group effort. “It’s usually me and my co-workers talking about movie references or big things in our childhood,” he said. “Nostalgia or something universal always does well.”The humble and ubiquitous chalkboard placed outside coffee shops, cafes, bars, restaurants or boutiques has slowly grown from a mere way to advertise that night’s specials or happy hours to a kind of showcase of wit, with puns, slang, pop-culture in-jokes, trivia, quotations and works of art.The signs share a predilection for being clever with social media. And perhaps they’re an analog art form perfect for our time, when we all wish to share our bon mots with everyone, all the time. It’s almost like tweeting on a chalkboard.Social-media forums like Instagram and Twitter have helped stoke their visibility, with users eager to post favorites. One Instagram account, NYChalkboards, with around 350 followers, exists purely to showcase the best in the city.It’s not simply a Brooklyn (or even a New York City) phenomenon. Carefully rendered chalkboards are abundant in London, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.; on certain streets in Los Angeles; and in college towns across the country — any place that shares a cafe culture with foot traffic.Think of “Sorry, I’m latte” carefully printed in a speech bubble above a drawing of a latte in a to-go cup addressing a group of frowning cappuccinos and iced coffees, or “omelet you finish” in colorful capital letters with a caricature of Kanye West, or a drawing of a purple acai bowl topped with fruit with “treat yo self!” in neon yellow underneath, or “Brunch Wars” carefully rendered in the “Star Wars” signature font.In Los Angeles, Erin Miller Williams works full time creating chalkboard art based solely on typography. “I call myself a hand-lettering artist,” Ms. Williams said.A typical cafe chalkboard would take her at least eight hours at $60 an hour. Since she began the business a year ago, all of her clients have found her through Instagram, Facebook or referrals.Robert Norman, the store manager and communications director of the New York City chain Think Coffee, regularly goes online to see if any of his stores’ boards are posted. He likes the signs to stay positive. “When the weather changes, I’ll write, ‘Maybe it’s time to grab an iced coffee, play hooky and go find the sun,’ ” he said. The upbeat tone is partly personal preference — “I like the whimsical ones” — and partly because of social media, in which “a whole group of people will see them that didn’t just walk by the store,” he said.In a market that is known by a few main, and some may say monolithic, players, this is a way for the mom-and-pop shops to show some personality themselves.“I don’t want to name names, but you go into a lot of places that are just boring, P.C., commercial and corporate,” said Christopher Taha, who owns Summers Juice & Coffee, a cafe in Williamsburg. “Our chalkboards say, ‘We’re just a neighborhood place, and I’m just a dude, just an individual owner; I’m not a corporate person.’ ”“We like to be as happy and smiley as possible — our name is Summers,” Mr. Taha added. Anything goes on his signs, occasionally including curse words as superlatives and joking references to dosing orange-juice shots with LSD. “I have a good sense of humor. Anything vulgar, bad words — I’m not against it.”He noted that the LSD board was one of the most popular and that it seemed to drive sales. “We sold more orange shots,” he said.Abigail Ricarte, a product designer from Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, is a fan of chalkboard art. “I absolutely love them, and I take pictures of them whenever I see a good one, and I’ll tag the location on Instagram,” she said. Anywhere near New York University and the West Village is particularly fertile, she said, as well as Cobble Hill, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill in Brooklyn.“I like noticing the different types of approaches,” Ms. Ricarte said. “Some play around with type. Others have a New Yorker’s sense of humor, someone who appreciates a good pun. Or ones that speak to how everyone is sleep-deprived in some regard, something or about the commute.”One of her favorites in recent memory comes from Tazza, a cafe in her neighborhood, whose chalkboard advertising cookies incorporated a lovingly drawn Cookie Monster pointing and saying, “I know U ♥ cookies.”“They brighten your day,” she said, adding that she realized they were ads. “It’s not a subway ad screaming at you. It’s a gentle, friendly neighborhood approach.”Not everyone is delighted by their whimsy, though. “Hating on these cheeky chalkboards is my pet project,” said Claire Carusillo, who lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where she is constantly confronted by them. “I see ‘IRL Tinder’ a lot. People think they invented that one.”“I’m hip to their endgame,” Ms. Carusillo added. “They want people to take pictures of their hip chalkboards about hip caffeine addiction and alcoholism, geotag them and put them up. But it doesn’t add to the experience when you walk in.”At Uva Wines & Spirits on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, the sign out front reads “Power Up With Wine!” with a red, white and blue drawing of Mario, of the Super Mario Brothers video game, clutching a bottle. The shop’s drawings, filled with nostalgic references or, in the words of the manager, J. R. Thomason, “bad puns, like ‘game of Rhones,’ ” which he said are meant to “endear the shop to the neighborhood.”Even Starbucks, the Goliath to these smaller coffee-shop Davids, has gotten into the chalkboard game. There’s a program called “Partner Pick,” in which baristas pick their favorite coffee and create artwork highlighting it. Aleah Fortenbery, a shift supervisor at Starbucks in Lexington, Ky., chose Bluegrass Blend, which she illustrated with “lush green fields and barns.”Nicolas Standish, that location’s store manager, said that the hand-drawn boards give results. “I’ve found that it improves overall engagement levels at the store with both customers and partners,” he said.For artists like Tyler Patty, who works at Intelligentsia Coffee’s Logan Square location in Chicago, working in chalk on a blackboard was a learning curve: “It’s inverted, so you have to think about light in a different way — you’re putting on light instead of shadow. I’m drawn to it because of that.”He has had work commissioned based on his cafe creations, he said. So has Mr. Ashworth, of Gimme Coffee in Williamsburg, who now designs posters for Brooklyn Bowl and Roberta’s.But chalk continues to be his preferred mode of self-expression. “I love the ephemerality of chalk drawings,” he said. “It’s there, and then it’s gone.”"

567ad33438f0d82150d5d97a,This Season’s Breakout Star: The Border,2015-12-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/arts/television/this-seasons-breakout-star-the-border.html,The New York Times,"Bud Buckwald and Ernesto González are neighbors. They live side by side in a small Southern California city perched along the border with Mexico: Mexifornia. Bud is a disgruntled midlevel Border Patrol agent (think Archie Bunker on desert foot patrol), and Ernesto is a plucky Mexican immigrant who runs a successful landscaping business. Bud looks at the changing demographics of America and doesn’t see a place for himself. His American dream is slipping away as Ernesto’s is coming true.“It’s like the Mexican’s become the Man,” he likes to say. “And I’ve become the Mexican.”The two families provide the comedic backbone of “Bordertown,” a new animated series executive produced by Seth MacFarlane (“Family Guy”) that debuts on Fox on Jan. 3. With often brutal satire that mines racism, xenophobia, drug cartels, mega churches, corrupt mayors, the pope and the occasional U.F.O., it offers up the border town as a prototype of the new American city, a key laboratory for thinking through the national future.“The border demands attention,” said Lalo Alcaraz, one of the show’s lead writers and a consulting producer, who thinks of Mexifornia as a new version of Springfield from “The Simpsons.” Mr. Alcaraz grew up in San Diego as the son of immigrants, just north of Tijuana and American border communities like San Ysidro and Chula Vista. “There are so many important stories here, which is why it makes for good television. You get all of the culture clashes: Americans and immigrants, Mexico and the U.S., and all of the mixtures that come with border life in general.”“Bordertown” arrives at an opportune, and extremely sensitive, political moment, with immigration a flash point in the presidential race. If elected, Donald J. Trump has promised to build a towering new border wall, has branded Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, and in August, famously deported the Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a news conference. In the most recent Republican debate, immigration reform and border security fueled a heated battle between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio over who had been the toughest — or the most lax — on policing the country against undocumented populations.Border talk is rarely just about the border itself. In both politics and popular culture, the border is a proxy for thinking about the role of Mexico in American life and for grappling with the ways Mexican immigrant culture and the American mainstream influence each other. It is both a scapegoat and a mirror: a place to project fears and anxieties about a changing nation, and a reflection of the identity-straddling, language-juggling multicultural nation that is already here.Beneath all the media bluster, undocumented Mexican and Central American immigrants continue to take enormous risks as they navigate the United States Border Patrol, Mexican drug cartels and deportation policies at both the federal and state levels. It’s a reality of morgue statistics and family separations that was lost on a particularly shameless Carl’s Jr. burger ad that appeared in September: a bikini-versus-bikini volleyball game that used the militarized border wall as a sexy Tex-Mex net.No wonder the border has played a starring role in so much culture this past year. Novels like John Vaillant’s “The Jaguar’s Children” and Don Winslow’s “The Cartel” unfolded through the voice memos of migrants trapped in truck trailers and the bloody global business of cartel bosses. Songs from Alan Jackson (“Mexico, Tequila, and Me”), The Game (“El Chapo”) and Juan Gabriel (“La Frontera,” a choppy remake of his ’80s pop classic) were additions to the border jukebox. The Houston rapper and comedian Chingo Bling (Pedro Herrera III) even did a spoof of “Antidote,” by fellow Texan rhymer Travis Scott. Mr. Herrera’s neighborhood gigolo doesn’t pop bottles, he sips “purple Fabuloso” (the popular Mexican floor cleaner), eats menudo on Sundays and is on constant Border Patrol alert: “I hear the migra at the front door.”Like so many Mexican and Mexican-American artists, Mr. Herrera flips traditional border narratives. A far cry from the “South of the Border” romance of Gene Autry or the jaundiced view of northern Mexico in Steven Soderbergh’s “Traffic,” these are border stories that typically push back against anti-immigrant sentiment and remind audiences that the border is also a vibrant, thriving region that millions of people call home.“The border should be redrawn as a circle,” said Mr. Herrera, who was part of the earlier viral YouTube hits “They Can’t Deport Us All” and “Started From the Border,” the latter a 2013 Drake parody that continues to have a second life as a Twitter hashtag. “Its influence is everywhere.”The border as both a circle of looping, mobile culture and a fortified line — a network of fences, walls, and surveillance — was also the subject of work this year by the visual artists Yoshua Okón, Postcommodity, and Ana Teresa Fernández. They all used the border’s physicality, contrasted with the ideas and traditions that cross through it everyday, to explore the politics of land and belonging in the contemporary Southwest. Or in Ms. Fernández’s case, she foregrounded it by making it vanish — painting portions of the Mexican side of the wall in Tijuana and Nogales the same blue as the sky.“I wanted people to imagine what it would be like if the border wasn’t there,” the Mexican-born artist said by phone from her studio in San Francisco. “What if I could just paint it away? It’s as absurd of a gesture as building the border wall itself.”Others have met the border on its own terms, tapping its power as both a ruthless market for people and drugs and a ruthless battlefield for racism and fear. These drama-friendly themes propelled both the film “Sicario,” which followed an F.B.I. agent on a cartel hunt through moral mazes and underground tunnels in the El Paso-Juarez region, and “Desierto” (a recent festival favorite bound for theaters this spring), which never leaves the rocky crevasses and dry washes of an unnamed Southwestern desert.Directed by Jonás Cuarón, who was born in Mexico and raised in the United States, “Desierto” rewrites the migrant journey north as a terrifying horror film. An American vigilante goes hunting for Mexican migrants, picking them off one by one with a shotgun and a vicious German shepherd.“The more you learn about borders the more you learn that they are the wrong way to see the world,” said Mr. Cuarón, who compares the film’s stark, minimalist portrayal of solitary characters against an extreme environment to the last film he helped write, “Gravity.” “When I scouted for ‘Desierto,’ deserts would spread to both sides, north and south of a line that you couldn’t always see. There is an arbitrary notion where one place ends and another begins.”While the film’s vigilante may remind some of the self-designated border guardians of the Minutemen and Arizona Border Recon (seen this year in the documentary “Cartel Land”), Mr. Cuarón insists that his film is meant to conjure archetypes, not individuals. It certainly wears its allegory on its sleeve: The killer played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan is named Sam, and Gael García Bernal’s migrant who lives long enough to be hunted is Moises (Moses). Mr. Cuarón said he wanted to represent “the rhetoric of hatred and fear of the foreign, of the other,” a rhetoric that he is quick to point out is not only at a fever pitch in the United States toward Mexicans and Muslims, but also in Mexico toward Central Americans and against migrants throughout Europe.Mr. Cuarón and Ms. Fernández are Mexican artists working in the United States, and as such, their work is as much about how America views Mexicans as how Mexicans view the United States. Nowhere is this shift in position more regularly at work than in the regional Mexican music industry, where predominately Mexican-born artists fill the Billboard charts with songs that depict, and comment on, the transformations and struggles of immigrant life.In November, at the annual Premios de la Radio award show in Los Angeles, a group of the biggest stars in banda and norteño music responded to Mr. Trump’s statements about immigrant Mexicans by teaming up for a glossy, Spanish-language music video parody of Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood.” Yet instead of Ms. Swift’s girl squad getting revenge on an ex-BFF, the Los Angeles radio personality and rapper Don Cheto and the Tucson heartthrob Luis Coronel lead their own squad of immigrant Mexican musical insurrectionists (including the duranguense queen Diana Reyes and the corrido veteran Lupillo Rivera) to take on Mr. Trump.“I left my home, my customs, my country,” Mr. Cheto raps, before comparing Mr. Trump to a member of the Ku Klux Klan. “We are the people who sustain this nation.” Mr. Cheto immigrated from the Mexican state of Michoacán, and Mr. Coronel is the son of undocumented immigrants from Sonora and Durango.“The border is ground zero for these artists,” said Lenard Liberman, the media executive behind Premios de la Radio who wrote the lyrics to the “Bad Blood” parody. “That’s what resonated with the artists in the video. These are young kids who came here, or whose parents came here, with a dream, and then they learn that if you have a dark face and a Spanish accent you are seen as a criminal. How is that not going to affect you?”There aren’t any references to Mr. Trump in “Bordertown” (the first season wrapped last year). But Bud Buckwald seems to share some of his views.“Bud is the white guy who feels things are changing too fast for him,” said Mark Hentemann, the “Family Guy” veteran who created “Bordertown,” and who is white. The new demographics of a country where whites will soon be a minority are already a reality in Mexifornia, and they hit Bud, and his anti-Mexican prejudices, in often personal ways: His left-wing, activist daughter gets engaged to the college-educated nephew of Ernesto.In one midseason episode, the decision to build a border wall, or “Freedom Wall,” using drug money discovered in the wreckage of a crashed cartel plane, wreaks havoc on just about every layer of life in Mexifornia. It threatens Bud’s job as an agent (he no longer has anyone to chase) and Ernesto’s landscaping business (he no longer has a steady stream of workers). Bud ends up getting fired and takes work wherever he can get it: first as one of Ernesto’s gardeners and then running an immigrant smuggling tunnel from his own basement.They all soon agree they were all better off without the wall. We watch it come crashing down.For all of the comedic punches that “Bordertown” lands, perhaps its greatest success is in determining who gets to tell the jokes. Mr. Hentemann assembled a staff that includes five Latino writers personally familiar with life in the borderlands, many of whom had never previously written for a scripted show. (Mr. Alcaraz, for example, is best known for his daily comic strip La Cucaracha, Gustavo Arellano is the editor of the OC Weekly newspaper, and the San Antonio-born Vanessa Ramos is a veteran of Comedy Central roasts.)For Mr. Alcaraz, this makes “Bordertown” something of a turning point in the way the border gets seen in the American media. It is a rare prime-time network representation of border life — albeit a cartoon bound to offend just about everyone — told, in large part, through Latino eyes.“Some people have their head in the sand as to how influential Mexico and Latin America are in the U.S.,” he said. “Not just people and demographics but culture. Americans live in this ideological bubble. ‘Rah-rah, we’re No. 1, and we’re all alone over here,’ and that’s just not true. We’re all interconnected, and we have to accept that interconnectedness. What better place to do that than at the border?”An article last Sunday about the ways that artists are changing the narrative about what differences truly separate Mexico and the United States referred incorrectly to the comic strip La Cucaracha by Lalo Alcaraz, who is also a lead writer on the new Fox animated series “Bordertown.” The nationally syndicated strip, which focuses on Latino and political themes, appears daily, not weekly. The article also referred incorrectly to the college-educated man whom Bud’s activist daughter gets engaged to on the show. He is the nephew of the landscaper Ernesto, not his son."

Spooked drivers locked their car doors. Residents cowered at home, fearful that a menacing tiger would devour them whole.But a little more than 24 hours after the French police began their frantic search, they concluded that the errant feline was no tiger but, possibly, a large or perhaps overweight domestic cat.At a time of economic and political malaise, the French could use a diversion, and the renegade beast — first spotted in Montévrain, a town east of the capital not far from Disneyland Paris — captured the national imagination, while also stoking more than a little fear.It may also have played into what commentators have said is a growing public anxiety, stemming from 14 illegal drone flights over French nuclear plants in recent weeks, raising concern about the security of the country’s main source of electricity. French authorities say they have no idea who was behind the mysterious flights.Then came the reports of a large wild cat on the loose, slinking around the outskirts of the French capital and eluding a hunting squad that included officers armed with tranquilizer guns and a helicopter equipped with a thermal detector. As of Friday evening, they proved no match for the elusive cat, which officials estimated weighed at least 100 pounds, based on the size of its tracks.The national agency for hunting and wildlife was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying that the cat was not dangerous. “It is between a domestic cat and a larger feline,” said Eric Hansen, an official from the agency, who also ruled out that it was a lynx.Nevertheless, a fuzzy photograph of the creature was circulated by the French news media, and minute-by-minute sightings have been reported here as if the country were on alert for a serial killer or U.F.O.The police said dozens of sightings have been phoned in. One driver reported spotting the cat crossing the A4, a major highway, prompting the authorities to tell drivers and residents in the area not to leave their cars, or, worse, venture into the woods. The feline was also seen stalking a gas station and prowling near the parking lot of a supermarket, news reports said.Writing on Twitter, Olivier Rimmel, an entrepreneur, mused that the obsessive hunt seemed to reflect a current French obsession with nonsensical things. “Every two days, a new bogus issue keeps us busy,” he wrote. “This time it’s a little tiger that is going to eat lots of children.”After it emerged that the tiger could, in fact, be an obese cat, Libération, the French newspaper, offered reassurance to its readers. “The tiger is not a tiger,” it wrote in a post on Twitter. “You can resume normal activities.”"

It’s fun.”There was a lot of fun going around in the Giants’ locker room in the wake of the team’s second victory of the week. And not just because of Manning’s fifth rushing touchdown in 168 career games.Burdened by a malfunctioning offense in two losses to open the season, the Giants are suddenly almost dominant offensively, having scored 75 points in two consecutive victories.The roster is full of surprises, with 12 new starters taking the field Thursday. One, tight end Larry Donnell, was not assured a job when training camp opened. Now he is leading the team with 25 receptions and has four touchdowns, including three against Washington.“When the offense is clicking like it is right now,” Cruz said, “there’s a lot of good places for the football to end up. And that keeps everyone smiling.”The metamorphosis of the offense actually began in defeat. A late fumble and other second-half mistakes led to a loss to the Arizona Cardinals in the team’s second game this season, but the offense was noticeably improved. Plays were run at a quickened pace, with the Giants smoothly going as many as three possessions without a huddle between plays.In the locker room after the game, the offensive players looked around at one another and nodded with the same recognition. The offense, installed by the new offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo, no longer seemed a mystery. The Giants were playing faster, but were not hurried. If anything, the game was slowing down.The same five offensive linemen had played two games together and were starting to protect Manning as a collective group, familiar with each other’s tendencies. As tackle Justin Pugh said, “If we can give Eli time, he will succeed no matter what the offensive system is.”The result has been an explosion of offensive capability. To be sure, the Giants were fortunate to be playing a developing team in the Houston Texans on Sunday and a Redskins team depleted by injuries. But there was a precision and a meticulousness to the offensive attack on Thursday that was impossible to ignore.Two weeks ago, McAdoo was being badgered with questions about whether Manning would ever adapt to the West Coast-style offense. In the last two games, Manning has completed 49 of 67 passes (73.1 percent) for 534 yards, six touchdowns and one interception — a miscue that was not his fault because the football was knocked from the grasp of a receiver.“Eli has had time to recognize his keys and go through his progressions,” Coach Tom Coughlin said Friday. “And when that happens, he is very accurate in terms of his over-the-shoulder throws and back-shoulder throws.“There isn’t any doubt he’s growing in the system and understanding how it can be utilized.”The introduction of a new offense begins with learning the new language of the plays, then the plays themselves, then the dozens of variations of each play and finally all the alternatives of each play based on the opposing defense, which also might change seconds before the snap and require another on-the-fly adjustment.The Giants were acclimating to all that while also welcoming six new offensive starters.“There were a lot of new things going on — new plays, new cadence, new people,” Manning said. “It was going to take some a while to get totally comfortable. But we’ve gotten better every week.”Manning’s new go-to receiver, especially on third downs and near the goal line, has been Donnell, an undrafted free agent from Grambling State who made one start last season.Manning conceded Thursday night that Donnell had probably exceeded his expectations.“Yeah, probably so, I think he just hadn’t had a whole lot of game action,” Manning said. “I was hoping he could play at this level. He’s done a good job understanding the timing of routes and made some tough catches.”Donnell, who is 6 feet 6 inches, is a former quarterback and basketball player. Cruz said he noticed Donnell’s athleticism as soon as he arrived in training camp in 2012, although Donnell ultimately spent that season on the team’s practice squad.“Larry Donnell is just a sheer athlete,” Cruz said. “I think he understands how to go up and get the ball wherever it is and understands how to position his body. I think that is because of his basketball background.“He’s just a very athletic tight end.”Manning recognizes Donnell’s skills, too.“We move him around and it creates mismatches that work for us,” Manning said. “And defenses have to pay attention to that.”Indeed, after Manning had thrown three touchdown passes to Donnell against Washington, the Redskins were sure to devote additional coverage to Donnell on a Giants play from the Washington 1-yard line late in Thursday’s game.That left Manning free to scamper untouched into the end zone.It was neither a U.F.O. nor a unicorn.Just Manning’s first rushing touchdown since 2011 and his second since 2008."

567944d438f0d85e45d816af,Finding a Warm Welcome in the Elqui Valley,2015-12-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/travel/elqui-valley-chile.html,The New York Times,"The hand-painted sign posted next to a rickety wooden footbridge signaled that we had found the home of Hermano Pacho, the best-known mystic in Chile’s very mystical Elqui Valley. Loosely translated from Spanish, it said: “My mission is to capture with science mankind’s new humanity. I am grateful to serve everyone. Hermano Pacho.”One by one, my wife, my two little boys and I walked across the narrow bridge toward a decaying A-frame-shaped cabin where I hoped to find a wise octogenarian spiritualist who reportedly subsisted on little more than potatoes and his own urine.Hermano Pacho wasn’t expecting us, but I hoped to ask him how the Elqui Valley came to be known as the Ruta de la Sanación, or Healing Path, a sort of rugged new-age South American Tibet, filled with mystics, swamis, psychics and stargazing ufologists.The cabin didn’t look big enough for more than one or two people, but there were enough items — a broken refrigerator, discarded pieces of furniture, toys — strewn about the property to suggest that Pacho had disciples living with him.I knocked on the door, but no one answered. A neighbor had told us that Pacho was hard of hearing, so I yelled out, “Hermano Pacho!” a few times, feeling very much like a deranged intruder.“Maybe we should just go,” said my wife, Jennifer.But it had been a tribulation to find the cabin. We couldn’t afford a rental car, and there was no public transportation in the area, forcing us to hitchhike to Horcón, a village about 15 minutes outside Pisco Elqui, the town named after the iconic drink where we were staying.A company called Tour Misticos offers a Ruta de la Sanación tour onboard a vintage psychedelically painted VW bus that includes visits with Hermano Pacho and Silvia the Gypsy (Silvia Guerra), another local mystic.But I was too cheap (and frankly too skeptical) to pay for an audience with mystics, so there we were on Hermano Pacho’s doorstep wondering what to do. The door was slightly ajar, and there was no padlock on the latch. As if reading my mind, Jennifer said, “You’re not going to just barge in, are you?”I missed out on Woodstock, I’ve never seen the Grateful Dead in concert, and I don’t own any bongs or tie-dyed T-shirts. And I’m generally distrustful of retreats that advertise themselves as centers for “healing” or “spirituality.”The Elqui Valley is full of these places, but I was seduced by the region’s other claims to fame — world-class stargazing, thanks to 320 days of sunshine per year; artisanal pisco distilleries; and the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of the poet Gabriela Mistral, an Elqui Valley native who was the first and, so far, the only woman from Latin America to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.We toured Los Nichos, a family-run pisco distillery where they claim that they’ve had four Chilean presidents fall down drunk on the premises, and signed up for a stargazing tour operated by Turismo Migrantes, a local tour company. But I realized after talking to the manager, Leonidas Tamblay, that I was more intrigued by Elqui’s hippies than its pisco and stargazing opportunities.Mr. Tamblay said that the Elqui Valley was an oasis for dissidents during the Pinochet dictatorship in the 1970s and ’80s and became a mecca for hippies interested in meditation and Eastern religions in the mid-’70s, after a pair of Tibetan monks came to the valley, apparently because Lhasa is 30 degrees north, while Elqui Valley is 30 degrees south in latitude.We would hear variations on this theme several times; no one was certain of the timeline or what happened to the monks, but several people told us that all of the energy, indeed the magnetic center of the earth, had flipped from Tibet down to Elqui.Claudia Rodriguez, a Chilean hippie who served as our interpreter on the stargazing tour, told us that the arrival of Halley’s comet in 1986, and a widely publicized “U.F.O. crash” in Paihuano, a nearby town, in 1998, brought swarms of mystics, plus ordinary hippies like herself, to the region and further enhanced Elqui’s Tibet-like reputation.“I moved here because this is where I found my tribe,” she said.Ms. Rodriguez said that if I wanted to understand the spiritual side of Elqui, I had to meet her guru, a Dutchman known as Swami Ritu. I had never taken Westerners who embraced Eastern religions seriously, perhaps because I had heard too many celebrities prattle on about the benefits of meditation.But after two chance encounters with meditation devotees — Sasha Contreras, a Californian who moved to Cochiguaz, a deeply eccentric hamlet reached only via a 12-mile jaunt down an unpaved road, and Mario Contreras, a Chilean guru — my wall of suspicion was melting.And our good luck on the hitchhiking front had me feeling that we had landed in a peculiarly welcoming place. A married couple from Valparaíso, Hector and Fernanda Vargas, who were meditating on what to do with their lives in a domed cabin in Cochiguaz, gave us a ride and also insisted on buying us dinner in Pisco Elqui.And a host of others picked us up — Rodrigo and Violeta, a couple with an aging pickup truck, hauled us around twice; Mari, a doctor from Santiago and her boyfriend, Matthias, brought me to and from Cochiguaz.Jennifer had feared that hitchhiking with our boys, Leo, then 6, and James, then 4, might be unsafe, or at the very least unwise. But they seemed to enjoy the novelty of hopping in and out of the flatbed of trucks, free of car seats and all the usual rules of the road they were used to.I shouldn’t have opened the door to the cabin, but I justified my decision to do so on the grounds that the venerable old mystic might be gravely ill or even dead. I opened it slowly, fearing the worst, but the place was empty save for an unmade bed, an oil painting of a woman on the wall and a single rack of clothing.I set off to find Swami Ritu alone the following day because Jennifer was convinced that my quest to find a swami who kept regular office hours was a waste of time. When I asked for directions to the swami’s house at the Rama Minimarket in Montegrande, as per Claudia Rodriguez’s suggestion, and was met with puzzled looks, I started to think that she was right. Walking outside the minimarket, I saw a sign for the Aguas Claras Condominiums.I walked down the alley, past a cluster of homes obscured by the fence, and felt like a lunatic calling out “swami?” to a man who, as it turned out, was an Australian disciple of the swami. As he led me toward the swami’s home, a small, wooden two-room affair with plenty of windows facing the mountains, I remembered that Ms. Rodriguez advised me not to visit the swami before noon, since he was a night owl. It was 11:30 a.m. and I feared that he might answer the door in his pajamas and curtly send me packing.My concerns evaporated when the swami greeted me warmly and welcomed me inside. He was wearing a pair of sweatpants, a fleece jacket and a pair of gray Crocs, and with his collar-length gray hair and ’70s-style tinted glasses, he reminded me of a college philosophy lecturer. The swami, whose real name is Bob Van Elk, told me his story over mugs of Lipton tea.As a young man living in the Netherlands, he was a “depressed, lost, wretched person” until he found enlightenment while studying meditation in India in the ’70s and ’80s. In 1990, at 46, he fell in love with a Chilean woman he met in India who was half his age. He followed her back to Chile; she left him, but he decided to stay on in Elqui.The swami started giving Buddhist meditation classes in the area in 1995, and as word spread that he offered not only free classes but also free accommodation, more and more hippies flocked to the area in search of enlightenment.The swami said that he had played a role in making the Elqui Valley the bastion of spiritualism it is today but acknowledged that many of the local mystics were little more than con artists.“We have people here calling themselves Zen masters who know virtually nothing,” he said. “Here, I have two conditions. One, I do not seek publicity. And two, I don’t charge anyone to take my classes or stay with me.”As I thanked him for his time, he said he had something for me, and I feared he might ask me to commit to his courses or make a donation to his school. Instead, he gave me a book he wrote about seeking enlightenment through meditation called, “Seeing Things as They Really Are.”I’ve never picked up a self-help book or anything remotely like it, but as I started to read it later that night, I wondered if perhaps I had been too hasty in dismissing meditation and Eastern spirituality for all these years. I highlighted lines like, “Tomorrow never comes because it will always be today,” “Desire is a kind of insanity rooted in ignorance,” and “The only thing that keeps us from being happy is the desire to become happy.” Simple concepts but ones I had never pondered before.Pisco Elqui is a delightful small town built around a palm-tree-lined square dominated by a pastel-colored cathedral that wouldn’t look out of place in rural France.I thought that the place was just about perfect until we ran out of money and discovered, on the morning we were set to leave town, that there was no ATM within a one-hour radius (Pisco Elqui now indeed has an ATM). Was this an omen? Was I meant to stick around, perhaps to study with the swami?We considered asking one of our new friends for a loan or hitchhiking all the way to La Serena, more than two hours away, but were spared when Jennifer found just enough coins hidden in her backpack to get us on a bus out of town.As we walked down a steep hill from our hotel toward the bus stop, baggage and boys in tow, we passed a wiry man with shoulder-length hair who had tried to help us with our bags when we had arrived in town on the bus, days before. At that time, I was certain that he was trying to steer us to a hotel, sell us a tour or God knows what else, so I told him we could manage on our own. He shrugged his shoulders as if to say, “Have it your way,” and stalked off.After seeing him in the square chitchatting amiably with people on several other occasions in the days that followed, we realized that he was just a kind person, not a hustler. I wasn’t in the same distrustful mood I was in when he first offered to help us. This time, I was ready for some help with our bags, but he just said hello and kept walking.We stepped onto the bus, which was empty save for the bus driver, and were greeted with the Culture Club song “Karma Chameleon” at earsplitting volume. It was our final only-in-the-Elqui-Valley moment.The airport nearest to Pisco Elqui is in La Serena, a two-hour drive.

5310fb5738f0d828e1cd44e1,An Alien March Madness: Is There Life in Space?,2014-03-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/01/arts/television/science-channel-and-nasa-in-marathon-on-life-beyond-earth.html,The New York Times,"It’s not an invasion from space, but it is an invasion about space. A batch of programs related to the heavens and what might or might not be lurking in them are coming in March, and the Science Channel gets things started on Sunday with a week of offerings on the theme “Are We Alone”? The answer, of course, is, “We have no idea,” but in exploring the question the Science programs at least prove one thing: No camera angle is too odd when the subject is extraterrestrials. Take, for instance, the presentations in “Close Encounters,” an embarrassing series being introduced with episodes on Tuesday and Friday. Using hokey re-enactments and a smattering of commentary by supposed experts, it dusts off old U.F.O. sightings — by a farm family in Kansas in 1971, police officers in Illinois in 2000, and more — that it says still defy explanation. All will be familiar to the U.F.O. crowd, and the program adds no new information or credibility to them, especially since the re-enactments have a silly 1930s look regardless of when the sightings occurred. And the “experts” — authors, self-described U.F.O. investigators — are shot in heavy shadow reminiscent of found-footage horror movies in which someone shines a flashlight on his own face in a dark room.And as if the shadow weren’t spooky enough, the camera angles for these expert interviews jump around ridiculously, often in midsentence. We’re looking the expert in the face for the independent clause, but for the dependent clause we’re suddenly staring into his ear. The filmmaking theory seems to be that if you discombobulate viewers with random shifts of the camera perhaps they won’t notice that your U.F.O. show contains no hard evidence of U.F.O.’s.The experts are better lighted and more credible in “NASA’s Unexplained Files” on Sunday night. The only thing missing is the “unexplained.” The program examines weird things NASA and its astronauts have noted over the years: odd lights observed by Leroy Chiao during a 2005 spacewalk; a triangular something-or-other seen from the space shuttle in 1986. The segments are teased with attention-getting narration and quote fragments: “I certainly hope it’s not a death star. Otherwise we’re in serious trouble.” But most everything turns out to be pretty explainable. No extraterrestrials here; just an assortment of interesting anecdotes.The heavy shadows are back on Wednesday in a new episode of “Through the Wormhole With Morgan Freeman,” and Mr. Freeman is the one shrouded in them, again an effort to add a mysterious ambience to the proceedings. But this always intriguing program, unlike “Close Encounters,” features real scientists and scholars and high-concept theories, with the barely visible Mr. Freeman as the guide.His subject for “Are We Alone?” week is, “Is God an Alien Concept?” At issue is whether other beings in the universe are likely to ponder the meaning of life and the possibility of God. That premise leads Mr. Freeman to introduce scholars and researchers who are exploring the nature of self-awareness — including in elephants — and the origins of religion. The space theme comes in when the program speculates on two possibilities. One is that an advanced civilization Out There will have outgrown God, just as some scholars think humans will as their scientific knowledge grows. The other is that when we ultimately make contact with extraterrestrials we will find that the thing that binds all beings together is their shared need for a concept like God, because some questions are unanswerable.If nothing else, “Are We Alone?” week sets the stage for the mix of dumb and smart space-related programming coming up. On the dumb side a four-part series called “The Happenings” begins on March 20 on the National Geographic Channel with an episode in which two illusionists try to convince an entire town that it is under alien attack.The smarter side: On March 14 the same channel is presenting “Live From Space,” broadcast in part from the International Space Station. And on March 9 comes the heavily promoted “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” on Fox and other outlets."
53f7809d38f0d835538dbe79,Who Are They Kidding?,2014-08-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/books/review/kate-dicamillos-leroy-ninker-saddles-up-and-more.html,The New York Times,"From Amelia Bedelia’s cheery misinterpretations to “Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus” and its impertinent bird hoping against hope for the impossible, delusions fuel a certain stripe of hero. Early chapter books — and here we have three by much-lauded children’s book authors — offer the perfect bridge between the freewheeling dreams of picture books and the serious narratives of longer fiction. These characters come by their delusions honestly and do not force the issue. And the more we indulge in their scattershot dreams, the more we want to believe in them too.In the case of “The Chicken Squad: The First Misadventure,” by Doreen Cronin and the illustrator Kevin Cornell (the creators of the J. J. Tully Mystery series), a world-weary retired search-and-rescue dog introduces us to four little troublemakers: Dirt, Sugar, Poppy and Sweetie may look like baby chicks, but they have ambitions far beyond mere scratching and pecking. With dialogue straight out of a ’40s film noir, they take on the case of a squirrel who has seen something “big and scary.” After some interrogation it emerges that the squirrel has seen something large, circular and noisy (in the squirrel’s own words, “it interrupted the atmosphere”). If a chicken can rush to a conclusion a chicken will rush to a conclusion, and these chickens are immediately convinced that a chicken-stealing U.F.O. is in their midst and that it’s up to them to take it down. Needless to say, the supposed U.F.O. is a mere barbecue grill, and the chicks’ efforts to destroy it ramp up the tale to maximum amusing chaos. Cornell’s illustrations give life to the chicks and their individual personalities. Each one pursues his or her own agenda, though they are often united in a common cause. Like four small, fuzzy, yellow Don Quixotes, they see giants in windmills or, in this case, aliens in backyard grills.Don Quixote also certainly comes to mind in the case of Leroy Ninker in “Leroy Ninker Saddles Up,” by the Newbery Medal winner Kate DiCamillo, with illustrations by Chris Van Dusen. (The two collaborated on the Mercy Watson series.) Leroy may harbor delusions of grandeur, but they are sweeter, softer yearnings than the chickens’. Leroy isn’t having a midlife crisis. He’s having a life crisis. Employed at the concession stand of the Bijou Drive-In Theater, Leroy dreams of becoming a cowboy. When Beatrice the ticket seller points out that he lacks the requisite horse, he sets out to procure one immediately. He imagines acquiring an impressive creature he can call “Tornado.” What he gets is Maybelline, an old, four-toothed equine who comes with her own set of rules. It’s love at first sight.DiCamillo, who is also national ambassador for young people’s literature, has always been at her best when dwelling on the good and the bad in relationships between humans and animals, and Van Dusen knows precisely how best to present Leroy to us. Seen here, the incipient cowboy is short and needle-nosed, but displaying that gleam you find only in the eyes of people pursuing their desires. When Maybelline disappears because of his negligence, he must take his fate into his own hands and then he must “wrestle it to the ground.” Leroy’s possible delusions instead transform him into a man honestly living his dream. We can laugh at how he goes about fulfilling it, but if he’s perfectly content at the end of the day, isn’t the laugh really on us?Digby O’Day of “Digby O’Day in the Fast Lane” has a dream as well, but it’s less grand than the desire to live life on the range. Possessing a car that he loves just as much as Leroy loves Maybelline, Digby and his best friend, Percy, intend to win the local All-Day Race from Dids­worth to Dodsworth. His rival, a saucy little minx named Lou Ella, has the audacity to purchase a new car every year and to mock Digby for sticking with his own beloved jalopy. With permission to go “by any route you choose,” what follows is an amusing adventure through the countryside, ending with a lovely pot of tea. It is a very British affair.Digby’s tale attempts an exciting feel but unfortunately lacks much in the way of verve. Even the art by Clara Vulliamy (daughter of its author, the beloved English children’s book writer and illustrator Shirley Hughes) stays neatly contained within the walls of the story. Both “The Chicken Squad” and “Leroy Ninker” are spinoffs from other popular series, yet both feel as though they are boldly striking out in new directions. Digby, in contrast, meanders about pleasantly, disinclined to do much that would strike a reader as the least bit unexpected. It’s charming, but what Digby lacks is the passion that comes with doing what you love. It’s the passion that spurs the chickens on to attack backyard equipment while camouflaged in grass clippings. The passion that inspires Leroy to charge through his neighborhood without hat or lasso in his slippery socks to find his missing horse. The passion that will encourage reluctant readers and early readers to keep turning those pages. Pages that will, in turn, help them to create more dreams than delusions, we hope."
53e0f09a38f0d815a9142405,How to Talk About America’s Newest Arrivals,2014-08-05,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/upshot/how-to-talk-about-americas-newest-arrivals.html,The New York Times,"American history is marked by periods of rapid influx of immigrants: the 1850s, the 1880s, and before and after World War I. American history is also pocked with anti-immigration action: the Know-Nothing political movement of the mid-1850s, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Immigration Act of 1924.Not surprisingly, given the importance of immigration in politics and to American society, it was more discussed during the times when more of it was taking place. Chronicle, the online tool that measures word usage patterns in The New York Times, reveals that the frequency in which articles using “immigrants,” “foreigners” and “aliens” reflects, almost exactly, those periods of a huge change in the American makeup. It also reveals how the choice of words changed subtly.“Foreigners” was definitely the term of choice in the period between the California Gold Rush and the Civil War, when there was a surge of immigration, mostly from Ireland and Germany. The term retained its popularity through the successive waves, much of it from southern and Eastern Europe, that largely came to a halt with the 1924 law.It really wasn’t until the 1980s that the word seemed to take on a pejorative sense. The Times never issued any prohibition against the word foreigner (though it did say aliens should not be used as a synomyn for immigrants). But “immigrants” became the more popular term in that era in which immigration boomed again. It has remained so as the federal government struggles with the large number of children from Central America crossing the nation’s southern border.“Aliens,” not the little green kind, never did pick up much energy. It generally was the second or third choice, until 1980 when all three terms appeared to have been used about the same amount. It’s unlikely its use was ever because of U.F.O. reports.What word usage changes intrigue you? This one, appropriate on the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I, is a favorite.

555f52e138f0d80e70a9ba47,"David Duchovny Returns With a New Series, and &#8216;The X-Files&#8217;",2015-05-24,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/arts/television/david-duchovny-returns-with-a-new-series-and-the-x-files.html,The New York Times,"SANTA MONICA, CALIF. — “I watch my daughter when she watches TV, and she never turns on a TV,” David Duchovny said recently at a seaside lounge here.He may have spent most of the past two decades starring in long-running TV series, but he’s still befuddled by how drastically things have shifted over the last few years, as hand-held devices, streaming services and binge watching have made appointment viewing seem increasingly antiquated. “I have no sense of the culture of TV watching,” he said.It’s hard to blame him for not recognizing the landscape he’s returning to via “Aquarius,” a patchouli-drenched crime drama set in late-’60s Los Angeles.The show, which has its debut on NBC on Thursday, stars Mr. Duchovny as a detective on the trail of Charles Manson before the Sharon Tate and LaBianca murders. It’s his first top billing in a network series since he played the U.F.O.-obsessed F.B.I. agent Fox Mulder on “The X-Files,” which remains his defining role. (One that he’ll be returning to soon.)“Aquarius” might be set nearly 50 years into the past, but it exemplifies the sort of forward-looking experimentation networks are undertaking as new challengers arrive in the forms of streaming services and traditional TV-watching models break down.The series was produced by Tomorrow Studios, a licensing arrangement that, as with NBC’s “Hannibal,” allows the network to fill programming hours without underwriting the production costs. (The show’s Thursday-night slot places Mr. Duchovny beside his once and future “X-Files” co-star Gillian Anderson, who is on “Hannibal.”)Year-round programming has become a necessity for networks, which once routinely filled summer weeknights with reruns. Networks “don’t want to lose the viewer momentum in the summer,” said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst for MoffettNathanson.NBC is also experimenting with a Netflix-style episode dump, releasing all 13 episodes on NBC.com the day after the show starts. A few weeks later, it will be available in two versions — the broadcast edition and one including coarser language and nudity — on iTunes.“Aquarius” opens in 1967, when a missing-teenager case involving an ex-girlfriend’s daughter puts Mr. Duchovny’s Sam Hodiak, a middle-aged Los Angeles cop, onto the trail of Manson, played by Gethin Anthony (Renly Baratheon to “Game of Thrones” fans). Along the way, Hodiak tries to negotiate the changing mores and seething racial unrest of 1960s Southern California.The Manson subplot is a “ticking time bomb” that adds tension to the story, Mr. Duchovny said, though he is more interested in how the Manson family murders, which will not happen in the first season of “Aquarius,” altered history by recasting hippies as homicidal boogeymen. “Manson the person is not that interesting; he’s just a petty criminal,” he said. “But as a symbol, he’s huge.”In conversation Mr. Duchovny manifests the same sardonic languor his fans have come to know over the past couple of decades. At 54, he scans about a decade younger and is still fit enough to pull off the occasional shirtless scene.The new series comes at a busy time for Mr. Duchovny, who has lately been branching into other media. (His Twitter bio: “Dilettante.”) He recently signed a deal to write his second novel — his first, the mostly well-received “Holy Cow,” came out in February. Earlier this month, in a development that surprised him almost as much as everyone else, he released his first record, a roots rock album titled “Hell or Highwater.” (He performed on the “Today” show on the day it was released.)The album arose from a hobby that began only a few years ago but expanded when his divorce from the actress Téa Leoni, finalized in 2014, left him with ample free time. He wrote all of the music and lyrics on the album, a Wallflowers-esque collection that vacillates between cleareyed ruminations on love and loss and wry sociocultural observations. He sings all 12 songs but hired a number of Boston musicians to play them because “I’m not a good guitar player,” he said.“I would say the album was a dream come true, but I didn’t dream that dream,” he said. “It’s the strangest thing that has ever happened to me, professionally.”Then there’s that other project that’s received some attention lately: the return of “The X-Files.” The new six-episode version of the beloved science-fiction series, which ran from 1993-2002 and spawned two films, will reunite Mr. Duchovny with Ms. Anderson, his original co-star, and Chris Carter, the show’s creator. It will begin shooting in Vancouver in June and have its debut on Fox on Jan. 24.The show, which began as an oddity but ended up a surprise hit, was wildly influential for its reliance on dense story mythology in prime time and its intelligent handling of genre fare like horror and science fiction. Not that Mr. Duchovny had any sense of its potential. “I was just trying to pay the rent,” he said. “It was a well-written pilot and kind of a cool character, this irreverent F.B.I. agent. But who’s going to want to watch a show about aliens?”The reunion concept had been kicking around for years, Mr. Duchovny said. “The time is right because we got our [act] together to do it,” he said. Though he left “The X-Files” before its run concluded and can seem ambivalent about the broad shadow it casts over his career, he said he looks forward to picking up the old flashlight again.“I’m as curious as anybody else,” he said. “I’m amazed that there’s still an appetite for it, and I’m touched.”Mulder remains Mr. Duchovny’s most well-known character, though his stint as the debauched writer Hank Moody on Showtime’s “Californication” lasted nearly as long, running from 2007 to 2014. (Notable early roles included a stint as a transgender D.E.A. agent on “Twin Peaks.”)But it was Mr. Duchovny’s awkward subplot on “The Larry Sanders Show” in 1996, in which he played himself as having a crush on Garry Shandling’s neurotic talk show host, that John McNamara, the “Aquarius” creator, recalled when he was casting the show.“He didn’t push it — he was comfortable being uncomfortable,” Mr. McNamara said. “That’s the quality Hodiak has to have: He’s comfortable, but he’s not comfortable, simultaneously.”“Aquarius” represents Mr. Duchovny’s first return to a law enforcement role since Mulder, and this time around he more conventionally looks the part. Some of the fun of the show comes simply from seeing him wander around free-love-era Los Angeles in a flattop and too-short ties — the styling signals Hodiak as a man out of his own time. Mr. Duchovny patterned the character partly after his father, a public relations executive and writer who died in 2003, who also wore a crew cut and adored Django Reinhardt.Most people “kind of take the side of the ’60s,” he said. “We love what it stands for, but not this guy. This guy has no clue what’s going on.”Hodiak reaches peak cluelessness in those moments when he’s confronted by the era’s loosening moral standards, which was one reason Mr. McNamara wanted to produce more provocative versions of the episodes alongside the broadcast ones. “He’s a World War II guy; he’s not a prude,” Mr. McNamara said. “But, boy, is he not used to seeing 20-year-old girls walking around topless.”The dual versions also allowed the producers to sell “Aquarius” overseas to channels that prefer more risqué content. “We can make it up as we go along,” Marty Adelstein, the chief executive of Tomorrow Studios, said of the show’s model.Mr. Duchovny added, “Who knew they loved breasts in Europe?”Later that evening, at a dinner with Mr. McNamara, conversation touched on the mechanics of shooting clean and blue versions of “Aquarius” — in some cases an actress shoots a scene, then removes her top and shoots it again — before veering off course, into bad Charlton Heston films and whether or not Ricardo Montalban wore a prosthetic chest in “The Wrath of Khan.” (It is reportedly all Montalban.) The two bonded in the early days of production over their shared love of the original “Star Trek.” The death in February of Leonard Nimoy also came up, specifically obituary writers’ tendency to employ Spock’s signature phrase “Live long and prosper” in appraisals of the actor.“I have some fear in that area,” Mr. Duchovny said. “I think about my own obit — are they going to end it with a lame joke?”“The truth was out there,” a reporter offered, which seemed to wound him a bit.“That’s exactly what I mean,” he said. He laughed without much mirth.“I kind of have to let go of it.”"

For full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger  (Saturday) After venturing down numerous experimental paths, including his morose piano-pop album, “Friendly Fire,” and a stint in the dance-hop group Cibo Matto, Sean Lennon has found the ideal outlet for his reedy voice and bohemian sensibilities. He croons in dewy-eyed unison with his girlfriend, the musician-model Charlotte Kemp Muhl, in this band’s fanciful take on 1960s psychedelic pop. They released “Midnight Sun” in April. With Summer Moon, Tall Tall Trees and Invisible Familiars. At 8 p.m., Baby’s All Right, 146 Broadway, near Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, babysallright.com. (Stacey Anderson)★ Pepito Gómez  (Sunday) This timba singer and bandleader is a former member of the popular Cuban band Pupy y Los Que Son Son. Onstage his high, chirped vocals are paired with joyous conga percussion and brass, inviting a nonstop dance party, which was the case during his exhilarating recent performance as part of the World Music Institute’s World to Brooklyn series. At Drom, he performs a tribute to the Buena Vista Social Club. At 5:30 and 8 p.m., 85 Avenue A, East Village, 212-777-1157, dromnyc.com. (Anderson)Holy Ghost! (DJ Set)  (Thursday) The breakout dance-pop act of 2011 pulls its stage antics from Freddie Mercury and New Order; its disco-ready riffs from the Bee Gees and LCD Soundsystem; and its cameos from, unfathomably, Michael McDonald. He’s fantastic, incidentally, on “Some Children,” which was one of the many addictive moments on this duo’s self-titled debut; the follow-up, “Dynamics,” released in 2013, was a more atmospheric effort. With Le Youth. At 10 p.m., Output, 74 Wythe Avenue, at North 12th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, outputclub.com. (Anderson)Lady Lamb the Beekeeper  (Tuesday) On her second album, “After,” which arrives the day of this show, the singer-songwriter Aly Spaltro, a.k.a. Lady Lamb, weaves plenty of anecdotes — on heartbreak, on familial love, on U.F.O. sightings. The disparate topics are grounded in Ms. Spaltro’s adroit folk-pop guitar playing and wintry vocals, which recall somber peers like Angel Olsen and Sharon Van Etten. With Cuddle Magic. At 9 p.m., Rough Trade NYC, 64 North Ninth Street, at Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, roughtradenyc.com. (Anderson)Maroon 5  (Thursday and next Friday) Loyal listeners of FM radio generally exist in a perpetual twilight loop of the current Maroon 5 hits “Animals” and “Sugar,” which blend amiable, poppish guitar riffs with the singer Adam Levine’s falsetto. The band joins another flashy, genetically blessed group, the reggae-rockers Magic! (whose “Rude” was a hit single last year), for two nights at Madison Square Garden. With Rozzi Crane. At 7:30 p.m., 866-858-0008, thegarden.com. (Anderson)★ Punch Brothers  (Thursday) This inventive young folk-bluegrass band opens its latest album, “The Phosphorescent Blues,” with the striking “Familiarity,” a 10-minute roots suite that beautifully captures the full bliss and terror of new love. The rest of the album is equally masterly, especially the singer-mandolist Chris Thile’s hearty vocals and the deft interplay of guitars, fiddle and banjo. It also churns along with fresh country and rock flair, courtesy of the producer T Bone Burnett. With Gaby Moreno. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 212-465-6500, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)★ Sleater-Kinney  (Friday) Many an indie-rock fan lamented the summer of 2006, when Sleater-Kinney announced its indefinite hiatus after 12 years together. Last month, the members, Corin Tucker, Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss, released their eighth album, “No Cities to Love,” and it’s a gripping comeback. The album is filled with taut punk riffs and its dauntless, alternately wailed and growled vocals are an exhilarating reclamation of feminist power. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Soul Clap and Dance-Off with Jonathan Toubin  (Saturday) DJ Jonathan Toubin, one of the most popular spinners in Williamsburg and the founder of the New York Night Train dance parties, is a knowledgeable student of American pop and soul music history. He reprises his soul dance party with Nick Waterhouse, an R&B and soul singer-songwriter from California. At 11:59 p.m., Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com. (Anderson)Suuns  (Saturday) These prog-rockers from Montreal take Hemingway-like economy with their tunes, stacking small fragments of dissonant melody into dense, enormous waves. Their 2010 debut album, “Zeroes QC,” merely suggested the sensational power of their live jams; the follow-up, “Images Du Futur,” carried a sinister pace and came closer to mirroring their thundering stage shows. With Disappears and Christines. At 9 p.m., Rough Trade NYC, 64 North Ninth Street, at Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, roughtradenyc.com. (Anderson)★ Synth Nights: Morton Subotnick  (Wednesday) The Kitchen is consistently brilliant in its booking of avant-garde performances, but it outdoes itself with this series, whose curators have included Laurie Anderson and Nico Muhly. This installment features the pioneering composer Morton Subotnick, a godfather figure in the world of electronic multimedia. His first full-length album, “Silver Apples of the Moon,” was a defining release for Mr. Subotnick and his label, Nonesuch, in 1967. Ahead of his 82nd birthday in April, he presents this light and sound duet with the visual artist Lillevan. At 8 p.m., 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Anderson)Tibet House Benefit Concert with Debbie Harry  (Thursday) The 25th installment of this annual fund-raiser features performances by a surprising crop of pacifists: Who knew that Debbie Harry followed such Zen pathways? She tops a roster that also includes the Flaming Lips, Laurie Anderson, Tenzin Choegyal, Sturgill Simpson, Ira Glass, Dev Hynes and the longtime Tibet House supporters Patti Smith and Philip Glass. At 7:30 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Anderson)★ Trash Talk  (Tuesday) A few years back these hard-core punk stalwarts from Sacramento signed to Odd Future’s label, which they nodded to on their 2014 album, “No Peace,” via a scabrous, minute-long instrumental track (“Amnesiatic”) with hip-hop undertones. The rest of the album plunges into the breakneck punk thrashings the band has perfected over the past decade, topped by the singer Lee Spielman’s self-flagellating yet defiant lyrics. With Ratking and Lee Bannon. At 9 p.m., Palisades, 906 Broadway Street, at Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, palisadesbk.com. (Anderson)Matthew E. White  (Tuesday) This spacey folk singer-songwriter delivers low, minimalist mumbles and bright peeks of falsetto over snug strings and brass orchestration. His lovely admissions, like “You give me joy like a fountain deep down in my soul” (from “One of These Days”), cause a few heartstrings to flutter. His debut album, “Big Inner,” landed in 2012; his full-length follow-up arrives on March 10. At 8 p.m., BRIC House, 647 Fulton Street, at Rockwell Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, bricartsmedia.org. (Anderson)Charlie Wilson  (Thursday and March 7) This funk veteran and former Gap Band frontman remains a prominent force in R&B: In recent years he has collaborated with Kanye West on the Grammy-nominated hit “Bound 2” and received a BET Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by Justin Timberlake. This smooth showman makes two stops in the area as part of his “Forever Charlie” national tour, with Kem and Joe. Thursday at 7 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, barclayscenter.com. March 7 at 8 p.m., Prudential Center, 165 Mulberry Street, Newark, 800-745-3000, prucenter.com. (Anderson)"

55e05b8f38f0d81634aff6c0,A City Rises in Queens for the U.S. Open,2015-08-30,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/nyregion/a-city-rises-in-queens-for-the-us-open.html,The New York Times,"Every August since 1978, a city within a city has popped up in Flushing Meadows, Queens. In just a few weeks, the corner of an almost 900-acre public park is transformed into the United States Open, along with its six fully staffed restaurants and 60 concessions stands, 20 stocked and staffed stores, five active loading docks, dozens of artfully landscaped tennis courts and strolling areas, a police force the size of a small Montana town, and three stadiums filled with passionate tennis fans, some of whom will probably soon be dancing the “Whip/Nae Nae” for the “spider cam” at Arthur Ashe Stadium. All of this hustle and bustle will help to bring in an estimated $700 million-plus for the New York area.“It is now a full-blown entertainment extravaganza,” said Justin Gimelstob, a Tennis Channel commentator and the coach for the American player John Isner. “The event captivates the most eclectic city in the world for two weeks.”The logistics involved in putting together the Open, which employs more than 7,000 people and welcomes around 700,000 fans every year, seem daunting enough without starting from a place of rubble and cranes. But that was the case this year. Because of the construction of Ashe Stadium’s new retractable steel roof, the dramatic tension involved was understandably elevated.Come Monday, once the qualifying rounds have concluded and the tournament has officially begun, the village will be bursting with sponsor activities, long food lines and glamorous watering holes, an astonishing transformation from just over three weeks ago. Destruction and desolation reign outside Ashe, but inside the stadium, a honeycomb of offices is abuzz with activity.When the 7 train approached the Mets-Willets Point stop, winding its way through the treetops before offering a glimpse of Ashe Stadium, it looked as though a giant white U.F.O. had glommed onto the top of the complex. That would be the roof, all 6,500 tons of it, which is scheduled to be operational for the 2016 Open.Because of the $150 million roof project, the area around the stadium was a construction zone until mid-August, delaying tournament preparations. “Setup has been anything but ordinary,” said Daniel Zausner, chief operating officer of the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.In early August, the grounds looked apocalyptic, as if everyone had just given up and gone home. There were unopened crates from the tournament’s 21 official sponsors, potted flowers yet to be planted, lonely, unmanned forklifts and piles of debris. The few individuals spotted seemed hard at work, though, including Dashaughn Miller, who had been hired to put together a new look for a cafe in the food village at the behest of a new promotional partner, Lavazza, an Italian company that is providing the “official coffee” for the Open.Mr. Miller was working near what would be the main entrance, which was filled with rubble and uprooted trees. The area had been torn up in order to provide a landing pad for the tallest crane in the country — shipped from Germany in December. The fountain in front of Ashe, surrounded by large piles of sand, was dry and cracked.On the far west side of the stadium, the five practice courts for the main-draw players were being rebuilt, having been demolished by a second crane. Now a grounds team had about two weeks to finish reconstructing and resurfacing them, which is a time-consuming process.“We had to give the construction group a drop-dead date of when we needed the area turned back over to us,” said Ryan Ferrera, the senior manager of courts and grounds of the tennis center. The crane left a month ago, to allow Mr. Ferrera’s crew to remove the rubble and put down new asphalt, which needed to cure for 30 days. About 10 coats of DecoTurf, a “rubber and sand” combo, he said, was being applied to the courts. All 33 courts reserved for the tournament receive about three new coats of DecoTurf every year, Mr. Ferrera said. “Most courts don’t go through as much engineering as these,” he said. “There’s a challenge with the footprint here; there’s a lot of movement, we’re surrounded by water.”The tennis center is also surrounded by a security presence, put in place by Michael J. Rodriguez, a former detective sergeant in the New York Police Department and supervisor for the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Mr. Rodriguez, who worked through the 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa and Sept. 11, “retired” in 2003 to work as the director of security for the U.S. Open and security adviser for the United States Tennis Association.A ring of private offices and hallways at the court level of Ashe thrummed with executive purpose, but Mr. Rodriguez’s command center was to be the hub of it all. Inside, there were rows of desks outfitted with large monitors for 18 people integral to the event, including members of the Police and Fire Departments, security operations managers, medical providers and deputy referees.Two women were seated in the back of the command center. They were security coordinators in charge of putting into effect Mr. Rodriguez’s strict and complicated deliveries system. “We had last year 1,842 truck deliveries in a two-week period,” he said. “So we have created internally one of the best truck inspection systems in the country.”Vendors must fill out a form detailing their trucks and drivers, who are then vetted, approved and given a bar code and specific directions to an inspection point outside the tennis center. “There’s only one way,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “Anyone who tries to come off a different highway to make a delivery, the police, who are stationed all around our perimeter, will never let them through.”The retail merchandise portion of these deliveries ends up at a warehouse behind the indoor tennis center. It is run by FMI, the merchandise concessionaire for the Open. On Aug. 7 — a few days after the warehouse opened for the season — it was mostly empty, with only about 100 boxes toward the back and a half-dozen workers, looking exhausted yet content. The work, they knew all too well, was just beginning.“See all the booths on the grounds we have to put merchandise in? We have to clean them all, we have to count every piece, everything that’s in these boxes has to be counted,” said Jeff Hilty, a manager for FMI.Mr. Hilty brought in some trusted employees to help get the process started. Millie Cruz of Queens Village specializes in invoicing, and her quiet, confident demeanor was welcome in a chaotic warehouse. Her sons, Thomas, 18, and Daniel, 15, were also brought in to work for the season. Thomas, who is starting at Queens College and was back at the Open for his third year, and Daniel, a rising sophomore at Bayside High School who was here for the first time, were “doing whatever we’re told to do.” The grounds of the tennis center have been rebuilt. This is the day for florists and landscapers, completing merchandising maps and receiving dry goods. Things were noticeably coming together. Promotional banners with big fuzzy tennis balls were hung on every post along the wooden-planked bridge from the subway stop to the tennis center. Construction workers were putting together a baggage-check area, and inside the grounds, larger banners, featuring tennis champions, past and present, had gone up. (It takes eight people to install the banners, Mr. Zausner said.)Inside Ashe Stadium, Ashley Devolder, 26, from nearby Astoria, painted a fresh coat of blue on a wall near the players’ entrance and media center. Before this task, she said, she had been part of a team of 20 who freshened up the 34,000 armrests on the stadium’s seats. “We had to sand them, clean them, and paint them,” she said. “It took a week.”Outside Ashe, rubble was removed and replaced by either grass or smooth asphalt. Lights were strung at the patio of Mojito, one of the Open’s sit-down restaurants, and a new bar had been built around one of eight hard-to-miss bright blue bases that support the new roof structure (Mr. Zausner’s idea). The main plaza was cleaned up, trees were replanted and colorful flowers were in place at the entrance.“We did the hanging baskets with wave petunia, and crotons and vinca,” said Kieran D’Arcy, a landscape designer with Garden World & Keil Brothers, a Flushing florist.Mr. D’Arcy said that in late winter, floral requests were sent to three or four growers on Long Island. Just after July 4, he said, a half-dozen landscapers started working with the 15,000 or so individual plants that arrived at the tennis center.The warehouse was now so full of boxes and workers that one could hardly navigate the place. Ms. Cruz and her sons were found in another area of the campus, setting up cash registers. When asked how his first job was going, Daniel, the 15-year-old, said: “At first it was a little hard and confusing, but now that I’m used to everything it’s pretty easy.”The retail stores, which would sell all manner of U.S. Open-branded clothing and souvenirs, were beginning to receive merchandise. Mary Ryan, the director of merchandising and licensing for the U.S.T.A., stopped by the Octagon, a popular store and meeting point among fans. At the counter, naked mannequin torsos awaited 2015 Open shirts.“Bring it on, let’s do this!” said Jeff Hilty, the FMI manager helping to oversee the warehouse. He was in the back of the store, surrounded by boxes and empty shelves, waiting on Ms. Ryan’s “merchandising map,” in which she details what goes where in each store.And then there’s the food. “This event has become as much about the food and beverage experience as about just being here,” said Craig Appel, the senior regional director of operations for Levy Restaurants. Levy oversees all food and beverage at the Open, including restaurants and concessions, Mr. Appel said. The company, which is based in Chicago, flew in 250 Levy managers and chefs, he said, and hired locally for everything else: some 2,200 waiters, line cooks, cashiers and busboys.Food deliveries were going on virtually round the clock at two loading docks, the main one at Ashe and a second behind the food village, Mr. Appel said. Underneath Ashe is what Mr. Zausner referred to as the stadium’s “city of refrigeration.” He pointed out a room where he said 12 butchers would work, and another where salads would be made in an assembly line. It is the day before players start to arrive for the qualifying matches. The grounds, beginning to pop and sparkle, are full of credentialed workers installing sponsor exhibits, moving merchandise or undergoing job training. In the players’ dining area, a 5,500-square-foot space with sweeping olive-color drapes and hardwood floors, where athletes and their entourages can have made-to-order pasta or quinoa bowls and sushi, a servers’ meeting was being held, and plastic packets of blue staff T-shirts were being distributed.Maribel Tufino, 22, from Park Slope, Brooklyn, who has worked at Starbucks, was training to be a barista at the Lavazza coffee bar in the players’ lounge. She seemed unfazed when she was asked what she would do if Serena Williams asked her for a cappuccino. “I haven’t seen tennis too much,” she said. A Lavazza trainer instructed five others on breaking down and cleaning the espresso machines.The lounge needed to be ready by the next morning, when about 200 players would arrive for qualifying rounds.At the entrance to the players’ quarters, the blue wall painted by Ms. Devolder had dried, and technicians were working on lighting both the media room and the main gantlet walked by the tennis players to enter the court at Ashe Stadium. It was a tech dress rehearsal.Outside, the grounds looked like a scene from a Richard Scarry picture book: Officials in polo shirts were riding around on golf carts; workers, elevated by scissor lifts, were polishing the structure that held the tenting over the food court; those merchandise crates were open, their contents being incorporated into interactive displays by teams of shirtless men; the once-dry fountain was spurting water; and forklifts were delivering goods to various stores and restaurants, in front of which sat stacks of boxes, waiting to be attended to. At Ashe’s loading dock, trucks were lined up to deliver products — tea, sugar, cups, ice machines, soda.North of Ashe, ESPN’s new mobile headquarters had grown from a pile of cables, crates and trailers a few weeks ago to a polished two-story broadcast compound, with nine studios that would be staffed by more than 100 people. To Ashe’s south, in the food village, was a slightly botched wallpaper job on the exterior of the Lavazza cafe, most likely noticeable only to Mr. Miller, who was preparing to redo it. “The lines don’t match up,” he said. Daniel Cruz, the 15-year-old warehouse worker, walked by the cafe looking harried, but focused. “I’m delivering power strips to the Polo store,” he said.Many other teenagers would soon be gathering for work between the Grandstand and Louis Armstrong stadiums. Tina Taps, manager of the U.S. Open ball people, emerged from the area clearly preoccupied with a new electronic scheduling system, not to mention training the 100 or so rookies who would be arriving in two days. But Ms. Taps, who has held this job for over 25 years, seemed confident. For one thing, her seasonal staff of approximately 275 includes a group of 20 or so veterans who mentor the new people, and they do not work these gigs for the money or the glory. “They’re doing it,” she said, “for the pure enjoyment of the event.”An article in some editions last Sunday about preparations for the United States Open tennis tournament in Flushing Meadows, Queens, referred incorrectly to Aug. 21 and the arrival of players. Aug. 21 was the day before players started to arrive for the qualifying matches; it was not the day before the qualifying matches."
55020e3438f0d8082e60d002,"A Dream, or a Premonition, Leads to a New Beginning  ",2015-03-15,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/style/a-dream-or-a-premonition-leads-to-a-new-beginning.html,The New York Times,"As a single parent, I was trying to make a go of it in Laguna Beach, Calif. My daughter wasn’t even a year old and my partner of many years hadn’t wanted to make it “legal,” so he was back East, as were the rest of my family and friends.I hadn’t expected to move to California, but when my teaching job in New York ended and a new one was offered out West, I thought: Why not? Isn’t California the place of fresh starts?But after two months, things weren’t going my way. There were rumors of a mountain lion in the hills above my house. My neighbors’ cat used our sandbox as its litter. My babysitter burned pots and hid them in places where she thought I wouldn’t look.And my daughter rarely slept. When I discussed this with her pediatrician, he said to put her in her crib and just leave her there.Instead, I took Kate on long car rides into the desert during which she slept, but she’d wake up as soon as we got home. On weekends I felt as if I had fallen off a cliff.I took care of Kate and graded papers during the rare times she slept. Her favorite activity was the drive-through carwash — I had the cleanest car in Southern California.One night, completely exhausted, I tumbled into bed and had a dream that I had gone to Richmond, Va. (a place I’d never been), and that Richard (my daughter’s biological father) was coming to kidnap her and take her into Canada, and I’d never see her again. I was desperately seeking someone who could stop him at the border.When I woke, terrified and trembling, it was Sunday, and I had another long day ahead.Time crawled on. My job was a two-year commitment and I was having difficulty making it through the first semester.Then one afternoon I got a call from an old friend who ran a workshop at Virginia Commonwealth University. He asked me if I’d like to spend two weeks in Richmond next summer.Kate was playing on the floor, inching toward an electrical socket, but I stood transfixed. Was this a cosmic joke? Premonition or mere coincidence, my decision was clear. Something was sending me to Richmond.Through the holidays and into the spring, I remained alone in a place where I had no family and few friends, a baby who didn’t sleep and a job I barely tolerated. It seemed as if I could get no traction in life.In search of a distraction I began hanging out with New Agers. I attended U.F.O. abductee support groups. I flew as an angel in the Crystal Cathedral. I went to channeling sessions where some women determined I hadn’t really given birth to my daughter.“So,” I asked, “who is the babysitter watching back home?”I dated a bit: blind dates, chance encounters. One man on our way to dinner said it was nice of me to allow the help to bring her child over. When I told him it was my child, he said I had betrayed him and refused to pay for dinner.I gave up dating. I gave up hoping. I devoted myself to my daughter and our lives as best I could.Anyway, I had so much to do I didn’t have time to think about the future. And for a time I didn’t think about that dream.Summer rolled round and it was at last time to meet my destiny, or whatever had called me to Richmond.My mother had agreed to take care of Kate for the first week. She would join me along with my 13-year-old nephew and Kate for the second.I was given an apartment in the Gladding Residence Center, a dormitory of cinder block walls. A rocking chair for Kate had been placed in the middle of the room.At Gladding there was only one other attendee, a young man named Larry. He was supposed to be in another workshop but the director moved him into mine. On our second morning, he was in line behind me at the cafeteria. He smiled and waved.He had a nice smile, bright blue eyes and a caring face. But I was in no shape to socialize. I was barely getting through the day. Then another student waved us over, so Larry and I wound up eating together.“What did you do this morning?” the other student asked us.I said I had read papers and critiqued them.“I took a walking tour of old Richmond,” Larry said. As he told us about the architecture and historical insights, I thought: What a nice thing. A man who takes himself on a walking tour.“I’d like to do that,” I said. “Are there any more tours?”“Well, there’s a slavery exhibit at the local historical society,” Larry said, laughing.We agreed to see it the next afternoon. The exhibit was predictably awful though its intent was to show how the slaves of Richmond fared better than others.We bonded over the bizarreness of the concept and then returned to Gladding, where it seemed they had closed the cafeteria for the rest of the summer.“Do you want to have dinner?” Larry asked. “There’s a nice tearoom nearby. I think it has Southern cooking.”I told him I had to do my laundry.“I could do your laundry,” he said.“You want to do my laundry?”“Well, I have to do mine as well — —”I paused to wonder if there was something creepy about this. Since Kate was born, I had taken care of her. No one had taken care of me. No one had offered.So I gave Larry my laundry bag, and two hours later he returned with my clothes warm and folded.That evening we went to Miss Morton’s Tea Room. Over dinner I asked myself, “Is this the moment I tell him I have an 18-month-old child, or should I just enjoy myself for another day or so?”I meant to tell him in the car, but he asked if I wanted to see a movie. It was blistering hot as we drove, my feet on the dashboard. We watched “Bull Durham,” laughing, enjoying ourselves.After, as we walked back to his car, I saw his license plate.“You’re from Ontario?” I asked.“Yes, I’m teaching in a place called North Bay.”Slowly the dream came back to me, the dream where I was in Richmond and desperately needed a Canadian to protect my family. It didn’t seem possible, but here we were. “So you’re Canadian?”Yes, he was.By the next night we were spending all our time together. I knew I had to tell him about Kate and then listen as he made pleasant excuses about wanting a family of his own or not being ready for responsibility. And that would be that.Over dinner I said, “I have something really important to tell you.”He nodded, looking concerned.“On Saturday my mother, my nephew, and” — deep sigh because I knew what was coming — “my baby daughter are arriving.”Larry cocked his head. “That’s it? You aren’t married or sick or something?”“No,” I laughed. “Why?”“I was worried something was wrong.” He smiled. “So what time do we have to pick them up?”A few weeks later I quit my job and moved back to New York, and soon Larry was flying down from Canada every weekend and Kate was starting to call him Daddy.I knew this couldn’t go on. When I called to tell him I wanted to break up, he told me he was moving to New York. “It’s not going to work from here,” he said.“All right,” I said. “But I don’t want to live together. I’m just not ready. And I have to think of Kate.”Larry asked if I would help him find an apartment.The next day my upstairs neighbor knocked on my door. A professional mime, she had just returned from doing street theater in Eastern Europe. She was rambling on about a Polish mechanic she had met and how it was love at first sight except she didn’t speak Polish and he didn’t speak English. So she was going to move there to learn the language. Did I know anyone who might want to sublet her apartment?Yes, I told her. I did.My grandmother used to say if it’s meant to be, it will be. Twenty-five years later I still think about that dream. Was it a coincidence or a premonition? Did I foresee this future, or did I make all of these decisions because of a dream?It has remained an enormous mystery, and a gift, to me. I do know that I had the dream and I have this life, and at times I cannot tell one from the other."

Jun Takahashi’s show had the pomp and circumstance of an uncanny jubilee. It left some of the most indelible images seen so far this Fashion Week.Mr. Takahashi’s models wore contact lenses that made their eyes red as those of white mice, with red lashes to match, and their hair was plaited and wound into extraordinary crowns. It gave the hint of a regal theme without the weight of literalness.Mr. Takahashi is a master of suggestion. Yet once the seed is planted, the eye adjusts. Suddenly the scarves that wove in and out of coats and sweaters, through zippered holes, took on a faintly regimental air. The braided rope versions that encircled coats was nearly passementerie.But this wasn’t merely a runway fantasy. Pulled apart, the pieces would be welcome in a civilian wardrobe. The zip-hole sweaters had an unfussy cool, as did the giant-cuffed slouchy suits with zippered lapels. There was also great outerwear, in particular a double-breasted trench with a back panel that dripped blanket fringe.Mr. Takahashi is also a man of few words. He would say little more than that he was thinking of “warmth and fear.” “He always wants to express two opposite feelings at the same time,” his translator explained. When pressed, he admitted, yes, he “wanted to break down royal things.”Forget the U.K. — was it anarchy in gay Paree? One of Mr. Takahashi’s primal scenes in fashion, as it were, was discovering Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren’s Seditionaries line, and its unofficial house models, the Sex Pistols, whom Mr. McLaren managed. Punk’s anti-piety continues to course through much of what Undercover makes. But this was less destruction than adaptation. It was respectful of royal beauty.The final looks had an ethereal loveliness. As the caped queens processed, flakes that looked like snow began to fall. Their snow-white outfits were bordered with Delft blue patterns borrowed from china plates. A closer look revealed that the patterns, like the toiles de Jouy that had come before, were infiltrated by flying-saucer U.F.O.'s.Mr. Takahashi, based in Tokyo, is a similar visitor to the sometimes stuffy palaces of Paris fashion — an emissary from another world."

The Adler regime came to power on the backs of scads of slackers who had not previously given two whits about how their homes were designed but were now making enough money thanks to the hipster economy that to continue in ignorance would be an error, but to give in to shabby chic or even all-midcentury-modern-everything would be, you know, lame.Enter cheek: the sort of home décor that’s both prim and also disruptive, thanks to the use of provocative colors or trims or language. But there’s nothing transcendent about this cheap kitsch, no visible hand of aesthetic agency. And so a countermaneuver was destined, and it has arrived in the form of a revival of handcrafted home items: pottery and dishes and cutlery and so on. It’s also an extension of the yen for artisanal food, a yen for something artisanal (or at least unique) to eat it out of.That leads to a store like Joinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which in addition to carrying men’s and women’s high-end utility clothing features a host of items for a well-ordered home. That includes hearty wide walnut display bowls by Tenebras ($90), a beautiful white enamel colander by Reiss ($68), and of course, a hexagonal teak candlestick ($35). (I mean, you can’t throw a Birkenstock without hitting a hexagonal candlestick these days.)Of the recent crop of Williamsburg housewares entrants, Joinery is the most earnest. At the other end of the spectrum is Beam, part of the Shops at 240 Kent mini-mall, which embodies design in a post-Adler world, keeping elements of his fanciful approach but mostly without its blunt force. There were surprisingly lovely silicone vessels with long, thin tops that ended in a point (as if they held a violent tagine) in chirpy colors ($140), and a smart Pablo lamp with a Lucite base (in bold fluorescent colors like pink and green) with a rectangular fabric shade ($125). Also by Pablo, the Pixo table lamp, a circular head like the U.F.O. in “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” atop a slender arm, fully adjustable and in bright colors ($199). I also loved the multipiece desk organizer in the shape of a ship ($64).Less interesting were the hybrid bone china plates by Seletti, gluing together halves of two styles to make a gauche whole. On the fence was a camouflage Chesterfield easy chair ($1,449). If it’s your one outré item of furniture, then great, but if it’s part of a loud chorus, maybe reconsider your vision.There’s a fine line between cute and cutesy, and Beam isn’t scared of wobbling on it. You can certainly buy a stuffed doll of Picasso, or Biggie Smalls, or Coco Chanel ($42). On the wall, and for sale, were framed preserved butterflies in electric blue ($468), in case trad taxidermy is too hairy and artisanal for you. These aren’t items that will make your home, or that take a stand, but they may communicate to someone that you think that you have.Once you have learned the distinction between those two things, you can go a few blocks away, to Abode New York, for a maturity upgrade and where, yes, I bought place mats. Beautiful place mats, made of multicolor basket-woven PVC yarn. And a beautiful white and aubergine salad bowl by ASA Selection, a German manufacturer that pairs dignity with panache.Abode exists on the accessible end of the design-degree universe. A tubular pendant light in primary colors by Cilandro ($255), a rubber tissue dispenser by Tunell, a waterdrop trivet by Toma ($45): all items you can display proudly, and that wink casually, not face-transmogrifyingly.Still, the charm of these pieces is largely digital. Almost certainly, they were designed on a computer, even if it was one with, like, an X-Girl sticker on it. If you want to see hands in action, you have to leave Williamsburg for Boerum Hill and the Primary Essentials, which is a shrine of the small batch. Surely you would like your morning muesli in one of the infinity bowls by Clam Lab ($120 for set of three), which look better cupped in your hand than on some dusty old table.Chen Williams has porcelain bowls made from a cast of a cantaloupe ($98), Nicholas Newcomb has a range of rough-molded ceramic spoons, and Helen Levi has a multicolor paint-splattered pitcher ($136) — all striking. Excellently and hilariously, the store also sells, for $45, the brackets it uses to mount its shelves, in response to customer demand. Let no home go under-beautifully bracketed.The Primary Essentials is in a calm white space on a thriving strip of Atlantic Avenue now in its second wave of commercial gentrification, and finally getting some polish. And just three doors down is the old Jonathan Adler store, windows papered over, phone line disconnected."

Lerner uses the strikingly unlovely word “coconstructed” to describe the shared nature of their experience: “We would work out our views as we coconstructed the literal view before us.” A few paragraphs on, he and an 8-year-old boy are seen “coconstructing a shoe-box diorama.” Later he can be found letting an Occupy protester shower in his apartment, wondering if it’s possible to “coconstruct a world in which moments can be something other than the elements of profit.”The word’s very clunkiness seems to indicate sincerity, but in each case the narrator’s apparently committed attempt to think through a moment of community — sharing an experience of art, playing with a child, giving hospitality to a stranger — is thrown into question by a detectable note of archness. At the Met he connects the painting to “Back to the Future,” a “crucial movie of my youth.” He and the 8-year-old plan “to self-publish” a book about dinosaurs. As he cooks quinoa (“an Andean chenopod”) for the unnamed Occupy protester, he muses on the left-­theoretical notion of “briefly placing a tiny part of the domestic — your bathroom — into the commons.” Does this ironic tone (which often feels like a reflex, a tic) preclude sincerity? Is all this talk of community no more than an artful confection, the purest kind of cynicism? The question is impossible to resolve, so each of these episodes — and indeed the book as a whole — takes on a sort of hermetic undecidability.Though “10:04” is preoccupied by the narrator’s relationship to others, particularly the possibility of “coconstructing” a child with Alex, his real compulsion is himself. Like Lerner’s previous novel, “Leaving the Atocha Station,” this is a book about self-consciousness. In a passage in which “the author” has fallen into the third person, Lerner summarizes: “His narrator was characterized above all by his anxiety regarding the disconnect between his internal experience and his social self-presentation.” In “Leaving the Atocha Station,” this anxiety was comically excessive, and Lerner’s alter ego seemed to stand in a long line of literary schlemiels, the genealogy of Philip Roth and Gary Shteyngart. “10:04” is an attempt to break out of this tradition of well-armored self-deprecation into — what, exactly? This is no kamikaze attempt at truthfulness or self-disclosure in the vein of Karl Ove Knausgaard. Lerner’s position is always hedged. Yet another tentative stab at community, looking for U.F.O.’s with a fellow artist on a residency, detours into private brooding. He resolves to scrap the book he’s working on, in favor of “the book you’re reading now, a work that, like a poem, is neither fiction nor nonfiction but a flickering between them.” The gloss has a whiff of control-freakery, of wishing to guide or pre-empt the reader’s response to the text. For a writer-narrator who aspires to being a Whitmanesque poet of collectivity, there’s a melancholy quality to this inability to focus on anyone but himself, and to his neurotic need to govern how he and his work are perceived. “10:04” feels like a significant book because it is so thoroughly inhabited by this yearning, and so abjectly conscious of the ways in which it falls short. The tension between irony and sincerity, between critical distance and full engagement, defines much contemporary culture and spills out into important political and ethical debates. Experiencing a moment of sublimity, looking at Manhattan from Brooklyn Bridge Park (“Whitman’s side of the river”), the narrator sees the “liquid sapphire and ruby of traffic on the F.D.R. Drive” and the illuminated windows of the buildings as “the expression, the material signature, of a collective person who didn’t yet exist, a still-uninhabited second person plural to whom all the arts . . . were nevertheless addressed.” In Ler­ner’s diagnosis, this possible “you,” the you of realized community, has been assaulted by the fierce ideological individualism of neoliberalism. His narrative ends in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, as New Yorkers find themselves separated into those with power and those without, and the lights of the Goldman Sachs building blaze out over the darkened street grid of downtown, an image he has chosen for the cover of the book. Formally “10:04” belongs to an emerging genre, the novel after Sebald, its 19th-century furniture of plot and character dissolved into a series of passages, held together by occasional photographs and a subjectivity that hovers close to (but is never quite identical with) the subjectivity of the writer. Its nearest relative is the work of Teju Cole, with whom Lerner shares an interest in art and the social fabric of cities. More confessional than Cole, it also shares much with Chris Kraus’s “I Love Dick” and Sheila Heti’s “How Should a Person Be,” and it is occasionally reminiscent of the work of Geoff Dyer, who will turn an essay on D. H. Lawrence or Tarkovsky into an occasion to dissect the oddities of his own personality. At worst, this kind of writing can degenerate into something like an artfully curated social media feed, but Lerner writes with a poet’s attention to language, and manages to make his preoccupation with identity more than solipsistic. His failure to make the Lerner who is experiencing things coincide with the Lerner who represents himself on the page and in the social world starts to feel, if not quite heroic, then certainly a matter that concerns all of us, as we obsess over our profile pictures and work out at the gym.“10:04” connects this anxiety about identity with metaphysical questions concerning time and repetition. The title is taken from “Back to the Future,” the narrator’s “crucial” childhood film, in which a town hall clock shows this time as Michael J. Fox is catapulted back to his own future, having successfully altered the past. It is just one of many moments picked out by Christian Marclay for his 24-hour video installation “The Clock,” which the narrator visits with Alex. The narrator redundantly looks at his watch as he watches this real-time compilation of cinematic timepieces, experiencing “the distance . . . between art and the mundane.” The book is prefaced by an epigraph, describing a Hasidic belief that the next world will be exactly like this one in all respects, except ineffably different. Without the ineffable, the world as re-presented can never quite coincide with the world as experienced. The narrator notices that whenever he crosses the Manhattan Bridge, he remembers having crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, because that is the bridge he can see. By way of illustration he shows two identical photos (taken on the Brooklyn Bridge), one captioned “our world,” the second “the world to come.” On the final page, he fleetingly closes the gap between the two worlds, between himself and himself. Gazing again at Manhattan, he finally feels able to look at it “in the second person plural,” saying wholeheartedly after Whitman, “I am with you, and I know how it is.” We find ourselves hoping that it is true, for his sake, and for all our sakes.

It’s vomit, straight from Lena Dunham’s lips into your living room, the latest example of a TV trend that deserves to die.Vomit is all over television these days, graphic and gooey. It’s all over movie screens as well. This viewer, at least, has to ask himself: Why?It used to be that if a television or film character were required to throw up, you would generally see him or her dash from the room, hand over mouth, and that would be that. The rest was left to your imagination, which had no trouble filling in the details, since just about everyone has vomited at one time or another.Over the years, things grew gradually more explicit. Instead of the dash from the room, you might see a dash to the wastebasket. Some audio enhancements started to creep in: gagging; squishy, splashy sounds. Still, actual vomit was almost never seen. The legendary projectile-vomiting scene in the 1973 movie “The Exorcist” seemed to sate the public appetite for about a quarter-century.Then, maybe 15 years ago, tastefulness began to give way to retching excess. And lately, it’s as if some kind of contest had been going on among the makers of TV shows to see who could get the most vomit onto the screen. Or maybe it’s a weird actors’ guild initiation rite: You can’t be in the union until you’ve expelled something solid from your mouth. If the suffix weren’t so overused, I’d call it puke porn. There was graphic vomiting in the Fox comedy “Enlisted” in January, and in Episode 2 of “The Spoils of Babylon” on IFC, and in the premiere of the Syfy drama “Helix” the same month. Comedy Central’s new series, “Review,” has an episode coming up that involves overindulgence in pancakes; you can guess the result. Pancake gorging apparently has the same effect on digestion as being exposed to rays from an alien spaceship: Even a cheesy re-enactment of a U.F.O. encounter this week on the Science Channel felt the need to show the eyewitness throwing up.I can already hear the mockery: “Look at the frumpy critic who wants to return to the days when TV couldn’t show married people sharing a bed.” But hold on. Expanding boundaries needs to have a purpose. Graphic vomit rarely passes that test.Increasingly frank depictions of sex, it can be argued, enhance television because the old passion-free TV shows were not a full portrayal of how people live, and besides, who doesn’t like to see a couple of good-looking actors get steamy? Violence and gore can be justified too, perhaps even more so: It’s important to show the ugliness of, say, domestic assault so that viewers don’t have the option of shrugging it off, of not confronting the problem.But vomit? Does it enlighten us somehow to see it full-on, as in the “Girls” episode? Does it illuminate a side of the human condition that few would otherwise appreciate or understand? Since many of these retchings occur in comedies, does it make a scene funnier? No; it just brands the show as juvenile. And, however it’s used, it commits the theatrical sin of taking you, the viewer, out of the moment by forcing you to look away or to pause to wonder whether they used oatmeal or beef stew or what. So, unless there is a weird subset of people who actually like looking at it in vivid, viscous detail, enough with the puking, please. After Ms. Dunham’s character drinks too much alcohol and then throws up in Sunday’s “Girls,” one of her sidekicks says, “I did not see that coming” (a phrase, by the way, that’s also overworked). Girlfriend, you’re the only one who didn’t see it coming, because here in the age of gag-inducing TV, nobody seems to respect a viewer’s ability to imagine."
53b1c19a38f0d835aaa9b614,"Movie Aliens, Scary and Cute",2014-07-01,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/science/movie-aliens-scary-and-cute.html,The New York Times,"When I was a kid, the scariest movie I never saw was “Invaders From Mars,” which recounts a sneak alien incursion through the eyes of a boy. It came out in 1953, when my own life revolved around the baseball field the dads in the neighborhood had built in the vacant lot across the street.During a thunderstorm one night, the boy in the movie, Danny, looks out his bedroom window to see a flying saucer sink into the ground nearby. Vortexes start appearing sucking people underground, where balls the size of peas are inserted into their heads to turn them into robots, including — scariest of all — his own dad. My parents wouldn’t take me to see the movie, but the previews were scary enough. I’d stand on the field after dinner watching the sun set over the Scotch broom that bordered right field, wondering if I would see something coming in the crack between day and night.Sometimes, I was scared I would. Sometimes, I was scared I wouldn’t.I was returned to my ball-field melancholies recently by the new science-fiction films “Earth to Echo” and “The Signal,” which have what at first look like surprisingly similar themes: Three kids follow a mysterious signal into the Southwestern desert. They find a terrifying alien presence with mysterious powers and are chased by sinister-looking men in trucks. In the end, much of what they have taken for granted turns out to be not true.But aside from this bare-bones frame, the two movies have hardly anything in common, including the way you will feel when you leave the theater.“Earth to Echo,” opening on Wednesday and directed by Dave Green, is essentially “E.T. the Extraterrestrial,” Steven Spielberg’s 1982 masterpiece, updated with iPhones and Google Glass. Interference on their phones leads Munch, Tuck and Alex into the desert on their bikes. It’s their last night together because their neighborhood is being demolished for a highway. Everybody has to move in the morning.The signal leads them to a damaged but unbearably cute little robot the size and shape of an owl, and then, with their classmate Emma, on an all-night scavenger hunt through pawnshops and junkyards for the parts it needs to power up, find the mother ship and get back home. (The action is recorded and narrated by the youngsters themselves on their devices, jumpy upside-down images and all.) Along the way, they keep encountering hard-eyed members of the highway construction crew who seem way too interested in what our heroes are up to.It culminates in an unlikely but emotionally satisfying C.G.I. tour de force — if emotionally satisfying is a term that can be applied to computer-generated images — back home in their backyards. I brought two 12-year-olds to the screening. They pronounced it “cool.”The kids in “The Signal,” directed by William Eubank, are a little older, students at M.I.T. — though perhaps only marginally more adept technologically. Nic and his best friend, Jonah, are driving Nic’s girlfriend, Haley, across the country to Caltech when they decide to take a detour to investigate a hacker named Nomad, who had gotten them in trouble at M.I.T. and seems to be monitoring them.They track the signal to an abandoned house in the desert, and there, all hell breaks loose. Nic wakes up in an underground hospital and laboratory run by people in hazmat suits. Haley is in a coma, and Jonah has disappeared.Worse, Laurence Fishburne, playing a doctor named Damon, is in his face. What he has to say might be very disturbing, he tells Nic in a smooth voice that will remind you of his role as the master of mysteries in “The Matrix.” But though Nic grows ever more frustrated and desperate, the doctor never tells him much of anything yet is always mysteriously in the way when Nic — at one point dragging Haley on a gurney — tries to escape.This is especially hard because Nic is in a wheelchair. When we meet him, he is on crutches, having lost the use of his legs to some unspecified illness. We are apparently in Area 51, the real Air Force base that is the mythical home of U.F.O. secrets. Has Nic been contaminated by an “extraterrestrial biology entity”? Is Damon an alien? Which way, actually, is “out”? Blue pill or red?Critics are divided on whether the plot of this movie, which wowed audiences at Sundance in January, hangs together or is just a virtuoso sequence of scenes. If “Earth to Echo” is from the Spielberg school of sci-fi, full of wonder and humanity, “The Signal” belongs more to the “Memento” and “Inception” school, in which the notion of reality is continually subverted and the final revelation may or may not serve to answer the questions that have piled up like snow in front of a plow.In that, perhaps, it is more like real life.But back to those aliens. Enrico Fermi, the great Italian physicist, once asked, in effect, ”Where are they?”: If extraterrestrials existed in anything like the numbers envisioned by astronomers like Carl Sagan, they would in the vast expanse of cosmic time have been here by now.Fermi’s question presumes that they or their artifacts are in fact not here. But how do we know?Astronomers have suggested in recent years that robots are a more effective way of exploring the universe. Mars and the moon have been surveyed from above for alien artifacts, but if there is something the size of an iPhone leaning against a rock in the Valles Marineris on Mars or the Tycho crater on the moon, it wouldn’t show up unless an astronaut walked past it. As for the earth, an entire jetliner disappeared without a trace this spring in the Indian Ocean.Anything could be here, including an owl-like robot in the desert.A more haunting and subversive question you might want to ask after seeing “The Signal” is whether even we ourselves are here. Why do we think so? Why, as many physicists wonder these days, do we even think there is a “here”?I finally did see “Invaders From Mars” on late-night television years later, when I was a grown-up able to laugh at Martian mutants in rubber suits with the zippers showing. It was a movie that ended almost happily, the flying saucer destroyed, the boy in his bed realizing it had been a bad dream.But then he slips over to the window. There in the distance, a flying saucer is sinking into the ground. I’m still standing by the old ball field, still peering out the window. Sometimes, I hope I’ll see something; sometimes, I’m afraid I will."

Typically, women like me keep their maiden names. But the catch for me is that I share a surname with several high-profile terrorists. I am not related to any of them, but my name often brings worried frowns during introductions and extremely thorough airport searches. I think taking a husband’s name in 2014 is regressive, but my fiancé’s surname is discrimination-proof and it sounds classy with my first name, too. Any advice?Anonymous“Say my name!” hissed the Walter White character on “Breaking Bad,” insisting that a posse of drug dealers call him “Heisenberg,” which was not his real name. And I routinely introduce myself as Matthew on long plane flights, after more than a few strangers tried to enlist my aid in having their children’s wedding announcements printed in this newspaper. We all have complicated reasons for the things we do.It sounds as if you would like to take your husband’s name, but feel guilty about it. Don’t. You’re not doing it in a show of subservience or for any “Ozzie and Harriet” rationale. the oddest of which may be so that as-yet unborn children never suffer the existential angst of having parents with different surnames. (They’ll survive.) Your change is more akin to Ralph Lifshitz changing his name to Ralph Lauren many moons ago: for branding purposes and in the hope that strangers like you better.I confess to a twinge of “when we change our names, the terrorists win.” I also worry about your losing credit for previously published academic work. (Do you?) But the aesthetics of your new moniker, which I promised not to share, really are lovely. Why not try it on for size? You can always switch back. They’re both your calls.Good Neighbor PolicyMy wife and I and our two young children live next door to an elderly couple who were married for a million years and lived in their house for about as long. It’s a beautiful place, much bigger than ours. Sadly, the husband died a few weeks ago. We didn’t know him well, and we don’t really know the wife, either. But we would like to offer to buy the house, if she would consider selling. It would be much better for our family, and the widow may want to downsize, too. How can I approach her without seeming crass?J.B., Westchester County, N.Y.Wow! Talk about “Barbarians at the Gate” (of the picket fence) — or my favorite ice-cold Wall Street expression, “If they’re crying, I’m buying.” Consider yourself under a six-month moratorium from discussing real estate transactions with your grieving neighbor. At its expiration, contemplate a three-month renewal. But if the widow seems herself again, stroll next door and say: “You probably don’t want to make any sudden moves. But if you ever decide to sell your beautiful home, my wife and I would love to buy it.” Then let it go and let your neighbor take the lead.It’s About Time My new boss is into all things supernatural. I wouldn’t care, except she often gets sidetracked during business meetings and starts talking about U.F.O.’s, voodoo and ghosts. She even stopped a conversation in midstream to point out clouds that she thought were suspiciously shaped. How should I respond to these lengthy tangents?  Would it be appropriate to say that I don’t buy into this supernatural stuff?Anonymous, New OrleansOf all the “what’s good for the goose is not good for the gander” inequities in our society, perhaps none is as pervasive as employee-boss relations. We underlings are often required to take loads of guff from above; our supervisors, nearly none from below. This is not true of all bosses and companies. But you haven’t given us a flavor for the hierarchy at yours, so tread lightly. (This goes double for new bosses.) Your continued biweekly paychecks may hang in the balance of her affection for you.The next time she begins a tale involving goat’s blood, say: “Excuse me, but I’m worried about the deadline for our Fisher presentation. Can we finish that up, first, please?” She may, and you may be spared the balance of her bloody tale, or not. Avoid pouring cold water on her enthusiasms. And take comfort in the knowledge that your boss’s boss (or H.R.) will soon pick up on her odd conversational gambits and squash them.Puppy LoveMy boyfriend and I are adopting a puppy from a shelter. We were shocked when they asked us to pay the cost of neutering him and having an ID chip implanted under the nape of his neck, in case he gets lost. We feel this is insulting, as if the shelter is telling us we’re irresponsible people. Should we pay?Geena, MassachusettsYes, you should pay for neutering your pup and inserting the chip, and not because you are irresponsible. (I bet you’re not.) But accidents happen, and if your pooch should wriggle free, won’t you be happy knowing that the chip may bring him home safely? (And that he won’t impregnate any female dogs while he’s on the lam?) Remember: he’s called a rescue dog because he’s rescuing you — from a state of extreme doglessness."
535d6fe438f0d8481d6f4ed6,Two Brothers in the Icy Grip of Midlife,2014-04-28,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/books/the-snow-queen-by-michael-cunningham.html,The New York Times,"Michael Cunningham’s resonant new novel, “The Snow Queen,” takes its title from the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same name about the redemptive powers of love and its ability to melt even the chilliest of hearts. Unlike his acclaimed 1998 novel, “The Hours,” which worked a series of inventive variations on Virginia Woolf’s “Mrs. Dalloway,” however, this latest book has only the most tangential relationship to the Andersen tale. (The hit Disney movie “Frozen” hews considerably closer to the original.) Mr. Cunningham’s “Snow Queen” takes little more than its central theme and wintry imagery from the original fable to create a contemporary story about familial and romantic love — love lost and found. The result is arguably Mr. Cunningham’s most original and emotionally piercing book to date. It’s a novel that does not rely heavily on literary allusions and echoes for its power — a story that showcases the author’s strengths as a writer and few of his liabilities, while creating a potent portrait of two brothers and their urgent midlife yearning to find some sense of purpose and belonging. Triads and triptychs seem to exert a special hold over Mr. Cunningham’s imagination: “The Hours” and “Specimen Days” (2005) both featured three stories linked by shared themes and motifs; and the stories in “Specimen Days,” like the novels “A Home at the End of the World” (1990) and “By Nightfall” (2010), pivoted around three central characters. The same is true of “The Snow Queen,” which focuses on the lives of a 38-year-old man named Barrett, who works in a vintage clothing store and who has just been dumped by his latest boyfriend; his older brother, Tyler, a musician with little to no following, and a secret drug habit; and Tyler’s ailing girlfriend, Beth, who has received a diagnosis of Stage 4 cancer. Around this three orbit a motley, sometimes shifting group of friends, lovers and colleagues, who together form a small Brooklyn solar system that Mr. Cunningham charts with sympathy, humor and psychological precision. The novel begins with Barrett having a vision — or a mystical experience — in Central Park one snowy evening in 2004: At first he thinks it’s a “freakish southerly appearance of the aurora borealis,” then it seems like something more metaphysical, like “the eye of God” looking down at him. After Googling “every possible malady (torn retina, brain tumor, epilepsy, psychotic break) that’s presaged by a vision of light,” he starts brooding over its meaning. Has he become one of those people who see U.F.O.’s and apparitions? Has the experience somehow changed him? Does it portend something good or ill? He decides not to tell his brother about what he’s seen: He “isn’t ready for Tyler’s skepticism, or his valiant efforts at belief. He’s really and truly not ready for Tyler to be worried about him.” As in earlier Cunningham novels, there is something faintly incestuous about the relationship among Barrett, Tyler and Beth; the down-and-out Barrett has moved in with his brother and had been helping care for the gravely ill Beth — they were her attendants; they were Team Beth. Tyler adores Beth, and Barrett feels much the same way, “though he does so because Tyler does.” Later, when Beth begins to make a seemingly miraculous recovery that may or may not be lasting, Barrett will wonder if his vision — his close encounter with whatever — somehow played a role in her dramatic turnaround. The brothers have been close since their mother’s sudden death (golf, lightning) years ago. These motherless boys, so gifted in their youth, have become middle-aged without ever quite finding their vocations or making a go of their talents. Barrett, “who’d seemed for so long to be the magical child,” developed an array of “languid capabilities (he can recite more than a hundred poems; he knows enough about Western philosophy to do a lecture series, should anyone ask him to”), but never “the ability to choose, and persist.” Tyler, blessed with “athletic ease” and a “singular gift for music” as a boy, has become, at 43, “an unknown musician,” tending his dying girlfriend in a dingy apartment with slanting floors in the depths of ungentrified Bushwick. There are fewer patches here of the self-conscious, purple prose that bogged down earlier novels like “Flesh and Blood” and “Specimen Days.” Mr. Cunningham seems to have harnessed his more sentimental inclinations, and instead of piling poetic phrases one on top of another to evoke his characters’ predicaments, he artfully allows the reader direct access to their hearts and minds by using his gift for empathy and his own brand of stream of consciousness (enhanced perhaps by his study of Woolf in writing “The Hours”). He gracefully delineates Tyler and Barrett’s family history, the often different ways the brothers have processed their common past, and the shared and withheld secrets that have defined their fraternal bond over the years. At the same time, Mr. Cunningham provides an impressionistic portrait of Brooklyn, circa 2004, and the East Village, some four years later, as America shifts gears from the George W. Bush era to the “change election” of 2008. These snapshots attest to his ability to give us an intimate sense of his characters’ daily lives, while situating their hopes and dreams within the context of two moments in history already slipping by.

So when one keeps him up at night, like “The Act of Killing,” it is quite an endorsement (and likely behind the reason he is distributing it through his Drafthouse Films). The genre-busting documentary, co-directed by the Texas-born Joshua Oppenheimer with Werner Herzog and Errol Morris as executive producers, re-enacts in surreal fashion the death squads in Indonesia in the 1960s.“It likes to juxtapose these really humorous, crazy moments with a punch in the face, so it leaves you a little bit emotionally raw,” Mr. League said. “It’s a masterful manipulation of the audience.”The film, which 14 Pews will screen this week, has been nominated for best documentary, but even if the Academy Award goes elsewhere, “The Act of Killing” has already won in one sense: it is putting pressure on the Indonesian government to recognize this genocide. If the movie does receive an Oscar, the stage will be absent a co-director who, along with the many other Indonesians who worked on the film, masked his identity for fear of reprisal. “It’s kind of a spooky ending,” Mr. League said, “watching the credits roll, and it’s just, ‘Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous.’ ”14 Pews, Feb. 1-2 and 4-6, 14pews.org.AUSTINBowie Sound PaintingFrom the release of his album “Space Oddity” in 1969 to “Low” in 1977, David Bowie was a chameleon, inhabiting the characters Ziggy Stardust and the Thin White Duke while jumping among psych pop, glam rock, funk and soul in his rise to stardom. “The Bowie Project,” a hybrid performance melding dance, theater and a live rock concert, will span this period, going backward in time from “Low” to make a statement about identity.“We’re trying to tell David Bowie’s story,” said Andrea Ariel, who choreographed the production, which features the Strike Anywhere performance ensemble and the Austin-based David Bowie cover band Super Creeps. “Where he came from, his fear of becoming insane, how does that connect with his past and his changing personas?”Through a method called sound painting, a sign language that draws from more than 1,000 signs for communicating with the various performers to compose a piece in real time, Ms. Ariel and two other “conductors” will “sculpt” the show. This leaves a lot of room for improvisation, and no two shows will be exactly alike.Stateside at the Paramount, Jan. 31-Feb. 2,arieldance.org.LAREDOAn I.F.O.

5320e2c538f0d80f6b2c83b5,Theories Grow Without Facts on Lost Flight,2014-03-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/world/asia/online-and-onscreen-disappeared-malaysian-flight-draws-intense-speculation.html,The New York Times,"It is the talk of lunchrooms, chat rooms and, most certainly, television green rooms across the globe: How and why could a modern passenger jet disappear without a trace?Along with the predictable U.F.O. theories, the suggestion, presumably facetious, that the television series “Lost” was secretly filming a new season became one of dozens of memes related to Flight 370, some more serious than others, on Twitter.On chat rooms frequented by pilots and aviation experts, there was more informed discussion of the technical possibilities, such as a sudden decompression or mass electrical failure, and of how a transponder could be shut down. But even the best-informed were arriving at logical impasses.The one constant, beyond the probability that a terrible tragedy lurked at the end of the story, was the factual void at its center, heightening the frenzy of speculation.“A main ingredient for rumor generation and transmission is uncertainty,” said Nicholas DiFonzo, a social psychologist at Rochester Institute of Technology and author of “The Watercooler Effect.”Also fueling the intense interest is the suggestion of continuing danger. “Anything that even hints at making us feel less secure or threatened evokes our attention,” Dr. DiFonzo said. “It’s hard-wired into us.”But the main reason for the fascination, he added, may be the sheer mystery, which allows everyone to play detective.So much uncertainty also opens the door for partisans to dwell on favored themes.Many American newscasters, after saying that “of course it is premature to draw conclusions,” have veered toward hypotheses about terrorism as they host the usual scramble of former Federal Aviation Administration investigators, pilots turned authors, security experts and, in this case, oceanographers, who helped, at their best, to establish the outer limits of what remained frustrated guesswork.CNN brought in Dan Rather, introduced as a newsman with long experience, to say, “I don’t rule out anything.” Robert Ballard, the deep-sea explorer who discovered the hulk of the Titanic, described the relatively shallow waters but strong currents of the Gulf of Thailand and the Strait of Malacca and wondered if the flight had continued into the Indian Ocean.Fox News was most aggressive with the terror theory. “I’m not afraid of the word terrorism,” Sean Hannity said as he pushed his expert guests to agree that given the latest statements from Malaysia that the plane appeared to have altered its route, foul play seemed all but certain. At the same time, Al Jazeera America, in its BBC-like fashion, was careful to stress the unknowns as the Malaysian authorities issued yet another contradictory account.In China, government officials sought to stanch speculation about terrorism as they expressed growing concern about Malaysia’s handling of the investigation. The country’s energetic bloggers were mostly restrained, but some theorized that the Malaysian military had mistakenly shot down the plane after it abruptly changed course, then covered up the action after realizing the mistake.In Iran, perhaps embarrassed that two of its citizens onboard had carried false passports, an influential lawmaker on Tuesday called the entire episode a form of psychological warfare by the United States to “sabotage the relationship between Iran and China and Southeast Asia.”The passionate global interest, the mystery and modern technology came together more constructively with a crowdsourced digital search of Asian waters organized by DigitalGlobe, a satellite imaging company based in Colorado. The company has made available new satellite photographs of thousands of square miles of ocean in the target areas, and by Tuesday more than 80,000 volunteers had scoured patches for signs of debris, according to The Denver Post. Among experts in advanced location technology, the discussion centered on why modern aircraft do not have foolproof distress devices. Hans Peter Brondmo, who directs innovations including global positioning and mapping methods for a unit of Nokia, noted in an interview that his sailboat carries a device that will rise to the surface and send a distress call in the event of a mishap. “The technology for finding something is there,” he said. “The question is, why haven’t we done that yet for airplanes?”Some of the most technically informed comments were posted on the Professional Pilots Rumour Network, a Britain-based chat room that despite its name is widely read in the aviation world and is one of the few “pilot chat room” sites that is not actually a matchmaking service.The comments — many from people claiming to be experienced pilots and crew members, who did not give their real names — included discussions of radar capabilities and of how communications are supposed to transfer between Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, and more talk than elsewhere, it seemed, about how sudden depressurization and lack of oxygen, known as hypoxia, could quickly render a crew and passengers unconscious.Of the lack of distress signals, a writer from Pennsylvania who said he was an experienced transcontinental pilot wrote, “With CPDLC, HF, VHF, ACARS and Satcom, I’ll find some way to get a message out under duress.” It would take “five seconds, top,” he said.Asserting that wreckage would be visible if there had been an explosion or structural failure, he posited either a hijacking or a “hypoxia event leading to incapacitation of all life on board.”A British writer responded, “If hypoxia is correct then why did all means of communication, manual or automated, cease so abruptly?”Even this crowd was not immune to wild speculation. One crew member wrote: “Could this aircraft literally have been ‘stolen’? Was there a cargo on board that organizations could seriously want and would take whatever measures to secure it?”These relative specialists shared in the frustration with Malaysian officials’ swerving accounts. “I think we’ve been spoiled by all the N.T.S.B. briefings,” with their “calm, clear delivery of information and faultless handling of journalistic queries,” a British commentator wrote, referring to the American transportation safety board."

52eb12c538f0d847470479c9,"A Year After a Sensational First Round, Mickelson Settles for a So-So One",2014-01-31,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/sports/golf/a-year-after-a-sensational-first-round-mickelson-settles-for-a-so-so-one.html,The New York Times,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — He started on the 10th hole, same as last year, but little else about Phil Mickelson’s par 71 in the first round of the Phoenix Open conjured memories of his sterling opening 60 a year ago. In 2013, when Mickelson lost a chance at a 59 by rimming out a 25-foot birdie putt on his last hole at T.P.C. Scottsdale, he hit 16 greens, took 24 putts and repeatedly used the word “heartbreaking” to describe the round. On Thursday, he found 11 greens, needed 30 putts and belabored all his “careless mistakes.” The crowds that came out early to catch a glimpse of the 43-year-old Mickelson, an Arizona State graduate, did not care that he was at less than his best. They were happy to see him at all.  Anybody who watched Mickelson wince his way through two rounds last week at Torrey Pines before withdrawing with a bad back thought there was little chance he would be able to defend his title here.  After pulling out of that event, the Farmers Insurance Open in his hometown, San Diego, Mickelson traveled to Atlanta on Sunday to have his back checked by the physical therapist Tom Boers, who had worked on him before the 2009 Presidents Cup. Mickelson’s lower back responded well to four days of rest and the treatment from Boers for locked facet joints. But Mickelson did not decide to play until he hit roughly three dozen balls at nearby Whisper Rock Golf Club on Wednesday afternoon. Early in his round Thursday, Mickelson clutched his back after a swing, but he refused to use his balky back as an excuse for his so-so score. He said: “It was a five-minute fix. I just have to be careful for a week or two as it heals up. It’s fine. Mobility is back. It’s just not a big deal. But I just didn’t play well.” Mickelson, a three-time winner of this event, was two over after three holes, but he followed a double bogey at the par-3 12th with back-to-back birdies. After two beautiful swings on the par-5 15th, he was left with a 14-foot putt for eagle. The greens are rolling faster than last year, but still, Mickelson looked shocked when his first putt ran 6 feet past the hole. He missed the next putt and walked off with a par, the same score he posted on the hole in 2013 on his way to a back-nine 29. “I wasn’t quite focused on every shot the way I need to be and let way too many shots slide today,” Mickelson said, using his three-putt at 15 as an example. He added, “Game doesn’t feel too far off even though I made quite a few careless strokes.” While Mickelson struggled, Kevin Stadler and Pat Perez, who make their homes nearby, challenged for the lead. Perez and Stadler carded 65s and were one stroke behind the leaders, Bubba Watson and Y. E. Yang. Ten golfers did not finish the round.Perez is coming off a tie for second in San Diego. If his name continues to appear on the front page of the leader board, he might be recognized for more than the car he drives. It is a Toyota model that looks as if it could fit inside a golf cart. Perez said the car was light enough to drive on the golf course. It stood out like a Big Wheel in the players’ parking lot. “It’s like driving a U.F.O.,” he said. “You cannot believe the attention that thing gets. It’s incredible.” Another player in the early wave, Nicolas Colsaerts, got off to an incredible start. He was six under through 14 holes. At No. 15, his drive found the water that runs along the left side. Once on the green, he three-putted for a triple-bogey 8. “I three-putted in anger,” said Colsaerts, who dropped another stroke when he found the water along the left at No. 17. Colsaerts signed for a 69 and hoped his wobble at the end would be as bad as it gets this week. In his debut here last year, he opened with a 65 and chased it with a 75 to miss the cut. He spoke Thursday about forgetting his mistakes and moving forward, something it has taken Perez several years to learn how to do. “Whatever happens, you just move forward from it and try not to make the same mistake again,” Perez said. Since Mickelson left Arizona State for the PGA Tour in 1992, a short memory has served him well. He has won 42 titles, including five majors, by trusting that his best shot will be his next shot; his best round, his next round. “The game doesn’t feel that far off,” Mickelson said. “There is that low round out there. There was one last year, and I just need one of those again.” "

It might also be applied to “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” Universal’s 1923 version of Hugo’s “Notre-Dame de Paris,” which, newly released by Flicker Alley on DVD and Blu-ray, was among the most unusual superproductions of its day.As suggested by its title, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” had two great attractions. There was the built-to-scale facade of the French cathedral that, along with acres of other sets representing medieval Paris, took a year to build and dominated the Universal lot for decades. “If there was nothing else to see in this film, it would be worthwhile to gaze upon the faithful copy of Notre Dame,” The New York Times’s anonymous reviewer noted. But there was something else: Lon Chaney as Quasimodo, the cathedral’s spectacularly deformed bell-ringer, not to mention a multitude of extras, estimated at 2,000 to 3,500 souls.A confluence of three grand personalities, “The Hunchback” originated with the enormously popular Hugo (“a madman who thought he was Victor Hugo,” Jean Cocteau once said) and was facilitated by the 23-year-old producer Irving Thalberg, who took advantage of his boss Carl Laemmle’s vacation to green-light a production far more lavish than Universal’s customary fare. The driving force, though, was Chaney. Optioning the novel in 1921, he attempted to finance an independent production; failing that, he brought the project to Thalberg, who allowed him unusual control over the script and cast. Chaney could also approve the director. While Erich von Stroheim was apparently considered, Chaney ultimately agreed to Wallace Worsley, with whom he had worked on four films.Essentially, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” is a showcase for Chaney’s brand of on-screen suffering. An experienced character actor in scores of films, many for Universal, he established a reputation in the years during and after World War I playing grotesque, usually villainous creatures, as well as for the pains he took to assume these roles. In “The Penalty,” a 1920 feature directed by Worsley (recently released on Blu-ray by Kino Classics), Chaney appeared as a gangster whose legs have been unnecessarily amputated — necessitating that the actor’s own limbs be tightly bound and encased in leather stumps.Hardly the lovable ogre of the 1996 Disney animation, Chaney’s Quasimodo is hideous. His body contorted by a hidden harness, he is bent double in a permanent simian crouch. His tongue lolls over a cluster of rotted teeth. One eye is swollen and dead, the other partly eclipsed by an enormous carbuncle. When he is stripped to be flogged, his torso is revealed as matted with fur. Thalberg’s production gave Hugo’s novel a happier ending, but Quasimodo (whose name can be translated as “half-formed”) is remarkably faithful to the writer’s physical description, including the monster’s “indefinable mixture of malice, bewilderment and sadness.”Not until John Hurt starred in “The Elephant Man,” more than a half-century later, would there be a comparable characterization. Chaney required four or five hours to prepare each day; the movie took three months to film, and he was in pain for most of it.In her history of Jazz Age masculinity, the film historian Gaylyn Studlar maintains that Chaney was “America’s greatest freak exhibit of the 20th century”; he also has intimations of the early century’s great catastrophe, Hollywood’s version of the disfigured war veterans the French called the gueules cassée (“smashed faces”). The typical Chaney protagonist, Ms. Studlar writes, was a humiliated, justifiably vengeful monster designed to “elicit revulsion and pity” and awe.Elmer Sheeley’s vast sets are alternately crammed with extras or impressively emptied out. The film develops its spectacle from that juxtaposition, as well as the interplay between Quasimodo and the mob. Introduced overlooking a Breughelian crowd in a scene that climaxes when he is crowned King of Fools and smitten with the Gypsy girl Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller), Quasimodo repeatedly upstages the masses. Astonishingly nimble despite his rubber hump and harness, Chaney capers up and down the cathedral facade. As if hypnotized by the 39-year-old actor’s athleticism, his supporting cast is prone to dramatic overemphasis — usually in vain.Released as a roadshow, “The Hunchback” was a critical and commercial success. Universal followed up with a second “Super-Jewel” prestige picture, “The Phantom of the Opera” (1925), again starring Chaney, and a third, adapting another Hugo novel, “The Man Who Laughs” (1928) in which, rather than Chaney, the German actor Conrad Veidt played the deformed hero. “The Hunchback” made Chaney a star and Thalberg a player. When Laemmle declined to raise the so-called boy wonder’s salary, Thalberg jumped to MGM. Chaney followed, where, in one of silent cinema’s great synergies, he was reunited for seven features with the circus boy turned director Tod Browning.There seems to be no surviving 35-millimeter material from “The Hunchback.” Flicker Alley has done yeoman’s work digitizing a subtly tinted 16-millimeter print, struck from the original camera negative during the 1920s, to produce a clean, low-contrast image. Donald Hunsberger’s score for the Blu-ray is modest and effective, if discordantly lighthearted during the scenes of mass tumult when, as, dwarfed by Sheeley’s sets, the roistering underclass runs amok through Paris.One needn’t see Quasimodo as a “half-formed” embodiment of the specter haunting Europe to sense a revolutionary undercurrent, or at least a premonition of the conflict that would erupt in the least likely movie Thalberg ever produced, Browning’s 1932 horror classic, “Freaks.”NEWLY RELEASEDTHE BAMBOO SAUCER Released without reviews in 1968, this Cold War artifact posits rival United States and Soviet teams searching for a U.F.O. gone down in remotest Red China; geopolitical competition is further complicated when local forces arrive. Dan Duryea, in his last film, plays the tough American squad leader. (Olive Films)THE FRESHMAN Harold Lloyd’s greatest commercial success was itself a satirical success story in which the bespectacled star plays a disciple of Dale, rather than Andrew, Carnegie. The movie was originally released in 1925, and it’s hard to imagine it ever looking any better than it does in this dual-format edition, digitally transferred from the 1998 U.C.L.A. restoration and packed with extras that include three newly spiffed-up shorts. (Criterion)THE PAST Having won an Oscar for “A Separation” (2011), the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi set his follow-up domestic melodrama, starring the French actress Bérénice Bejo, in Paris. “The narrative complications can be distracting, at times exasperating, but they’re finally irrelevant, because Mr. Farhadi’s filmmaking is so fluid, and the performers, Ms. Bejo, in particular, are so attractive,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times in December. (Sony Pictures)SHOW BOAT Can’t help lovin’, however ambivalently, James Whale’s 1936 version of the Jerome Kern musical, if only for the presence of Helen Morgan and Paul Robeson. Hattie McDaniel is also on hand, mismatched with Robeson, but nonetheless demonstrating her vaudeville-honed skills as a blues stylist.

5349b09f38f0d86082ad9b74,"From Boom to Rust, Lavish Projects Are Languishing in Brazil",2014-04-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/world/americas/from-boom-to-rust-big-projects-are-languishing-in-brazil.html,The New York Times,"PAULISTANA, Brazil — Brazil plowed billions of dollars into building a railroad across arid backlands, only for the long-delayed project to fall prey to metal scavengers. Curvaceous new public buildings designed by the famed architect Oscar Niemeyer were abandoned right after being constructed. There was even an ill-fated U.F.O. museum built with federal funds. Its skeletal remains now sit like a lost ship among the weeds.As Brazil sprints to get ready for the World Cup in June, it has run up against a catalog of delays, some caused by deadly construction accidents at stadiums, and cost overruns. It is building bus and rail systems for spectators that will not be finished until long after the games are done.But the World Cup projects are just a part of a bigger national problem casting a pall over Brazil’s grand ambitions: an array of lavish projects conceived when economic growth was surging that now stand abandoned, stalled or wildly over budget. The ventures were intended to help propel and symbolize Brazil’s seemingly inexorable rise. But now that the country is wading through a post-boom hangover, they are exposing the nation’s leaders to withering criticism, fueling claims of wasteful spending and incompetence while basic services for millions remain woeful. Some economists say the troubled projects reveal a crippling bureaucracy, irresponsible allocation of resources and bastions of corruption. Huge street protests have been aimed at costly new stadiums being built in cities like Manaus and Brasília, whose paltry fan bases are almost sure to leave a sea of empty seats after the World Cup events are finished, adding to concerns that even more white elephants will emerge from the tournament. “The fiascos are multiplying, revealing disarray that is regrettably systemic,” said Gil Castello Branco, director of Contas Abertas, a Brazilian watchdog group that scrutinizes public budgets. “We’re waking up to the reality that immense resources have been wasted on extravagant projects when our public schools are still a mess and raw sewage is still in our streets.”The growing list of troubled development projects includes a $3.4 billion network of concrete canals in the drought-plagued hinterland of northeast Brazil — which was supposed to be finished in 2010 — as well as dozens of new wind farms idled by a lack of transmission lines and unfinished luxury hotels blighting Rio de Janeiro’s skyline.Economists surveyed by the nation’s central bank see Brazil’s economy growing just 1.63 percent this year, down from 7.5 percent in 2010, making 2014 the fourth straight year of slow growth. While an economic crisis here still seems like a remote possibility, investors have grown increasingly pessimistic. Standard & Poor’s cut Brazil’s credit rating last month, saying it expected slow growth to persist for several years.Making matters tougher for the government, it is an election year, with a poll last month showing support for President Dilma Rousseff’s administration falling to 36 percent from 43 percent in November as sluggish economic conditions persist.Ms. Rousseff’s supporters contend that the public spending has worked, helping to keep unemployment at historical lows and preventing what would have been a much worse economic slowdown had the government not pumped its considerable resources into infrastructure development.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Ms. Rousseff’s political mentor and predecessor as president, put many of the costly infrastructure projects into motion during his administration, from 2003 to 2010. In a recent interview, he acknowledged that some of the ventures were facing long delays. But he contended that before he came into office, Brazil had gone for decades without investing in public works projects, so the country essentially had to start from scratch.“We stayed for 20 years without making or developing any public infrastructure projects,” Mr. da Silva said. “We had no projects in the drawer.”Still, a growing chorus of critics argues that the inability to finish big infrastructure projects reveals weaknesses in Brazil’s model of state capitalism.First, they say, Brazil gives extraordinary influence to a web of state-controlled companies, banks and pension funds to invest in ill-advised projects. Then other bastions of the vast public bureaucracy cripple projects with audits and lawsuits.“Some ventures never deserved public money in the first place,” said Sérgio Lazzarini, an economist at Insper, a São Paulo business school, pointing to the millions in state financing for the overhaul of the Glória hotel in Rio, owned until recently by a mining tycoon, Eike Batista. The project was left unfinished, unable to open for the World Cup, when Mr. Batista’s business empire crumbled last year.“For infrastructure projects which deserve state support and get it,” Mr. Lazzarini continued, “there’s the daunting task of dealing with the risks that the state itself creates.”The Transnordestina, a railroad begun in 2006 here in northeast Brazil, illustrates some of the pitfalls plaguing projects big and small. Scheduled to be finished in 2010 at a cost of about $1.8 billion, the railroad, designed to stretch more than 1,000 miles, is now expected to cost at least $3.2 billion, with most financing from state banks. Officials say it should be completed around 2016.But with work sites abandoned because of audits and other setbacks months ago in and around Paulistana, a town in Piauí, one of Brazil’s poorest states, even that timeline seems optimistic. Long stretches where freight trains were already supposed to be running stand deserted. Wiry vaqueiros, or cowboys, herd cattle in the shadow of ghostly railroad bridges that tower 150 feet above parched valleys.“Thieves are pillaging metal from the work sites,” said Adailton Vieira da Silva, 42, an electrician who labored with thousands of others before work halted last year. “Now there are just these bridges left in the middle of nowhere.”Brazil’s transportation minister, César Borges, expressed exasperation with the delays in finishing the railroad, which is needed to transport soybean harvests to port. He listed the bureaucracies that delay projects like the Transnordestina: the Federal Court of Accounts; the Office of the Comptroller General; an environmental protection agency; an institute protecting archaeological patrimony; agencies protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and descendants of escaped slaves; and the Public Ministry, a body of independent prosecutors.Still, Mr. Borges insisted, “Projects get delayed in countries around the world, not just Brazil.”Mr. da Silva, who oversaw the start of work on the Transnordestina eight years ago, was frank about the role of his Workers Party, once the opposition in Brazil’s National Congress, in creating such delays. “We created a machinery, an oversight machinery, that is the biggest oversight machinery in the world,” he said, explaining how his party helped create a labyrinthine system of audits and environmental controls before he and Ms. Rousseff were elected.“When you’re in the opposition, you want to create difficulties for those that are in the administration,” Mr. da Silva said. “But we forget that maybe one day we’ll take office.”Some economists contend that the way Brazil is investing may be hampering growth instead of supporting it. The authorities encouraged energy companies to build wind farms, but dozens cannot operate because they lack transmission lines to connect to the electricity grid. Meanwhile, manufacturers worry over potential electricity rationing as reservoirs at hydroelectric dams run dry amid a drought.Other public ventures sit vacant. Officials in Natal, in northeast Brazil, spent millions on wavy buildings designed by Mr. Niemeyer, opening them in 2006 and 2008. But they abandoned them almost immediately, allowing squatters to occupy some areas; the authorities now say they have plans to refurbish the buildings. Another Niemeyer project, a $30 million television transmission tower in Brasília designed like a futuristic flower, remains unused two years after it was inaugurated.Then there is the extraterrestrial museum in Varginha, a city in southeast Brazil where residents claimed to have seen an alien in 1996. Officials secured federal money to build the museum, but now all that remains of the unfinished project is the rusting carcass of what looks like a flying saucer.“That museum,” said Roberto Macedo, an economist at the University of São Paulo, “is an insult to both extraterrestrials and the terrestrial beings like ourselves who foot the bill for yet another project failing to deliver.” "

5311037c38f0d828e1cd4503,Ugly? It’s a Crowd Pleaser Now,2014-03-02,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/automobiles/collectibles/ugly-its-a-crowd-pleaser-now.html,The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA — Look at a new car that you think is preposterous. Chances are good that 50 years from now, when few like it remain, it will attract a crowd of admirers on the street. Such is the case with Chris Rossi’s 1960 Lincoln Continental Mark V, an ungainly beast that, even when new, redefined the boundaries of excess at a time when behemoth cars were the norm.But on a sunny day here, driving with the windows down, hoots of admiration from passers-by came wafting into the turquoise interior of the four-door hardtop. At one point, an entire family out for a Sunday stroll — parents, children, grandparents — stopped to stare and smile. “That’s some car,” one of the adults said.Bombastic styling and outrageous dimensions make the Lincoln look like a comic book villain’s daily driver, but in the sea of modern automotive sameness it commands the sort of attention an alien spacecraft might conjure up — especially if the U.F.O. were 19 feet long and wore two-tone Pale Turquoise-over-Sapphire paint.“I have a theory,” Mr. Rossi said, his mustache stretched above a grin almost as wide as his car’s grille. “If I drove past a crime in progress, it would cease.”As the words left his mouth, a guy in a Mini Cooper pulled alongside. “Man, you could fit one of these in the trunk of that — throw it in as a spare,” he said, laughing.By the end of the 1950s, American cars had reached epic proportions. Not to be outdone by flamboyant offerings from Cadillac, Imperial and others, Lincoln countered with an all-new model line for 1958, topped by the Continental Mark III.The same essential cars continued through 1960. They were Brobdingnagian in scale and an expression of dimensional absurdity.In “The Lincoln Story: The Postwar Years,” Thomas E. Bonsall wrote that auto magazines like Motor Trend were initially enthusiastic about the new models. But a recession in the introductory year, and lukewarm owner feedback, delivered a one-two punch to the heavyweights. The immense, overstyled cars quickly looked dated and ended up on the back lot, largely unappreciated by collectors.Understanding the lineage of Lincoln Continentals is a bit like trying to comprehend the inheritance rights of a family of English nobles whose patriarchs often outsourced their passion. The Continental nameplate first appeared in 1939 on what was commonly called the Mark I. Ford Motor made the Mark name official in 1956-57, when it sold an exclusive handbuilt model, the Mark II. But that opulent car was not a Lincoln but a Continental, which was established as a separate Ford division in 1956-7.For 1958, the Continental Mark III made its debut — as a Lincoln once again — and it was succeeded in the subsequent two years by the Mark IV and Mark V. Ford even created a short-lived Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln division.Collectors tend to gravitate to the elegant cars that came next, starting with the clean-lined 1961 Continental that had distinctive center-opening suicide doors. The Mark series lay dormant until Lincoln brought the name back for 1969 with a personal luxury coupe, the Continental Mark III; by choosing that name, Lincoln essentially rewrote its own history, picking up where the Mark II had left off and ignoring the overwrought Marks of 1958-60. But these cars, like just about any automobile, have their fans. One such aficionado is Mr. Rossi, 47, who says he travels the world building stage lighting arrays for major events — including the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and the 2011 Pan-American Games in Mexico.But why the Mark V? He was not even born until 1966, long after these cars were new.He explained in an email: “I did not know at the time, but for me, my family’s ’67 Mercury Park Lane two-door fastback with a 410-cubic-inch motor was the unique car that started it all. My parents bought it new in ’67, and we had it all through my young life. Its uniqueness led me to look for its ’50s counterpart.”But he didn’t stop with Mercurys. The Lincolns of that era were even rarer.“The Marks, with their sheer size and sculpting, are just jaw-dropping,” Mr. Rossi said. “And if you’re mechanically minded, the way they were built is just as intriguing, if not awesome. They simply demand your attention from far away.”With innovative unibody construction, rather than the typical body-on-frame, and styling distinct from anything else in Ford Motor’s lineup, the Lincolns had bulk to match their size, weighing more than 5,000 pounds.These were among the largest unibody cars ever made and, with their canted headlamps, mouthlike grilles, exaggerated body sculpturing and huge slab fenders, are often dismissed as Lincoln’s most garish creations. (In fact, the division ignored them in a 1990s video of its history.)But what once seemed gaudy is now, in the eyes of many beholders, rather grand. With Mr. Rossi’s friend Mike Goldberg along for the ride, we took a drive past many of Philadelphia’s historic sites. No matter where we went, everyone who spotted the car smiled. When Mr. Rossi parked outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art — above the steps Sylvester Stallone made famous in “Rocky” — the car was almost instantly surrounded by tourists posing for pictures with it.To ensure that a visitor would truly appreciate his Lincoln, which Mr. Rossi bought in 1991 from a private owner, he allowed me take the wheel. For such a big car, it handled much better than I had expected, even with its old-fashioned bias-ply tires. Naturally, body roll around turns was pronounced, although not markedly so. But gliding along parkways, the old Lincoln proved an exceptional machine for cruising. Except for the muscular burble of its engine, the Mark V floated silently, air slipping in through its open pillarless side windows and slipping out the back through the optional roll-down Breezeway rear window.We approached a knot of slow-moving traffic in the right lane, and Mr. Rossi directed me to “drop it down to the passing gear.” I pressed the gas pedal to the floor, swung the wheel left and grinned as the huge 430-cubic-inch V8 — which by 1960 had been detuned to 315 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor, from 375 with four barrels in 1958 — came to life with a deep rumble. Wind rushed past us and out the reverse-slanted back window. As we passed what looked like an empty industrial building, Mr. Rossi told me that it was once owned by the Budd Company, which he said made train cars and, among other things, the one-piece bodies for cars like his. Further research showed that the bodies, hoods and deck lids of Lincolns and Thunderbirds of that period were indeed produced by Budd, although most likely at a factory near the Lincoln assembly plant in Wixom, Mich. If the drive was a lesson in Philadelphia history — Mr. Rossi was happy to share details of his city’s colorful past — it was also a tutorial in anachronistic automotive gadgets. The Mark V had a number of them: Bendix Treadle-Vac power brakes; the Bendix Travel Tuner, a floor switch that let your foot control the AM radio; and, of course, the trick rear window. Though unnecessary with today’s air-conditioned cars, the Breezeway was an attractive option when artificial cooling was less common.The leather interior is unrestored but quite presentable, with plenty of space for six adults. Or, in our case, three adults, a bag of camera and computer equipment and three cheesesteaks obtained during an obligatory call at Tony Luke’s. Between that stop and a slow cruise through Laurel Hill Cemetery, which offers great views of the Schuylkill, I felt like a movie mobster in a 1960s crime drama.Mr. Rossi’s affinity for M.E.L. cars goes beyond his Lincoln. He is also restoring a 1959 Mercury Park Lane Convertible. Content to let other collectors swoon over high-dollar Mark IIs and Kennedy-era Continentals, he is a self-appointed custodian of the overlooked and underappreciated, adjectives that have sometimes been applied to his historic hometown as well."

In a few weeks, Jansen’s strandbeests — the huge self-propelled beach-striding contraptions that Jansen has spent the better part of the past quarter-century conceiving, evolving and constructing from out of ever more ambitious concatenations of lightweight yellow PVC tubing and spiny white sails — would be strutting their improbably lifelike stuff up and down Miami Beach at Art Basel, to the drop-jawed amazement of all. But for the moment, Jansen had to carefully, with near-veterinary skill, slice and fold six of the wide-slung beests into two 40-foot-long shipping containers, so that they would survive the rigors of their Atlantic passage.It was along this ridge, raised many years ago to shield the residents of the housing development down on one side from the noise of the highway on the other, that Jansen first established his winter studio compound (itself made up of several repurposed shipping containers) as a place where he could labor during the many months each year that he wasn’t able to actually parade his strange creations along the North Sea beach where they truly belonged (and where he kept a similar summer compound). Parts of superseded strandbeests lay strewn about the grounds, their yellow shafts blanched bone white, and a shed off to the side contained miles more straight, still-yellow PVC tubes, stacked in neat rows, waiting to be transmuted into future generations. (‘'Life, from its most primitive to its most advanced manifestations, consists largely of protein,'’ Jansen once told me. ‘'PVC is my protein.'’)Jansen was snipping a cord-tie here, sliding a pipe sleeve there, reducing the beests into manageable segments, which his assistants were gingerly lugging downslope to the first of the two containers, sitting on a flatbed truck parked by the side of the highway’s frontage road. Francesca Williams, a registrar at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass. (which is managing an entire strandbeest tour of the United States), supervised the uploading of beest segments, checking items off the list on her tablet and occasionally rejiggering some of Jansen’s characterizations. (‘'Strangle rods?'’ she muttered at one point. ‘'Middle foot bones? I don’t think so: We’d better recast some of these terms for the customs people.'’) Her colleague Trevor Smith, the Peabody’s recently appointed ‘'curator of the present tense,'’ who was also in Ypenburg, told me why his newly renovated museum was the perfect anchor venue for the coming beest incursion. ‘'People forget,'’ he said, ‘'that Salem was once one of the most thriving townships on the Eastern Seaboard, its wealth grounded in far-flung sea trade, especially with Asia, hence the museum’s origins in a collection of all sorts of marvels and wonders the sea captains brought back with them from their various expeditions. And Jansen’s beests fit right in with that spirit of marvel, curiosity and enterprise, an entirely contemporary manifestation of the temper that animated the place’s collecting in the first place.'’Jansen himself now came trudging down the hill at the head of a team delivering a particularly intricate segment (a geodesic tangle of crankshafts from which dangled four pairs of extended legs), and he immediately joined in, noting that he himself had only just returned from Nagasaki, Japan. ‘'The beests have been all over — to Melbourne and Buenos Aires and Taipei and London and Paris and Madrid, and even for brief one-offs at MassMoca several years ago and at a TED conference in Monterey — but where they are really very big is in Japan, we have a whole herd of them, as it were, migrating all about the place,'’ he said. ‘'Nagasaki was their fourth show in the country.'’ Jansen went on to relate how this recent visit to Nagasaki had been especially bracing, owing to the city’s atomic resonances and because at one point his hosts took him to Dejima, the artificial island beachhead that the Dutch East India Company used back in the days, from 1641 to 1859, when the outpost served as the otherwise resolutely quarantined Tokugawa shogunate’s sole trade window onto the West. ‘'Once a year,'’ he went on, ‘'specially vetted servants would carry the company’s headman on a palanquin inland to pay a call on the emperor, not unlike us today, come to think of it, ferrying these beest segments down here to their containers.'’After they land in Miami Beach and then in Salem in the fall of 2015, the beests will spend the following year or two alighting at the Chicago Cultural Center (winter to spring 2016), the Exploratorium in San Francisco (summer 2016) and possibly in New York after that, among other places. And everywhere they go, visitors will be subjected to Jansen’s soaring contention that what they are witnessing is in fact nothing less than a new form of life — and indeed life in the very midst of going viral, and not just in the hackneyed cultural sense.At this stage in any exposition of the strandbeest saga, listeners often tend to interrupt along lines like, ‘'Wait a second, we’re just talking flights of fancy here, works of art, figures of speech — right? — these creations of Jansen’s can’t actually be considered a species, they aren’t actually alive.'’ But the thing of it is that, as far as Jansen is concerned, yes, his strandbeests actually are taking on life, they are coming alive. Or so, anyway, he keeps insisting.Jansen is a tall, clean decanter of a man still quite preternaturally youthful, somehow containing a mischievous Hals-like gleam in the outer trappings of an upright, dignified Rembrandt burgher. He was the youngest and most coddled of 11 children, born soon after the Allied liberation of Holland to a farm family that had been forced into cramped quarters in an urban apartment in the Scheveningen district along The Hague’s northwest seashore. Jansen describes his as a happy if somewhat impoverished youth. One afternoon, over lunch off Beestenmarkt Square in central Delft, he recalled for me how in the old days the plaza in front of us was thronged with cattle, and his father, who’d become a roving, bicycling health inspector, would bring him along when he was testing the cows for tuberculosis. Another time, as we found ourselves gazing upon Rembrandt’s ‘'Anatomy Lesson'’ in a nearby museum, noting the way the surrounding students in the painting gawp as the professor demonstrates with his own free hand the way the muscles in the cadaver’s bloodily exposed arm make possible a whole wide range of manual dexterity, Jansen recalled how as a kid he used to love dissecting chicken feet.Adept at both drawing and math, Jansen put in seven years at Delft University of Technology on the physics track. But then he realized that he was never going to be happy ‘'working as a robot for Philips electronics,'’ and thereafter he gave himself over completely to the more ‘'hippieish'’ pursuits of music-making and painting that had been calling out to him all the while. Late in the 1970s, he and a group of friends managed to commandeer an abandoned school off a Delft canal (one that Werner Herzog had just abandoned after shooting ‘'Nosferatu'’ there) as their studio and living space, and he has been living there on and off ever since.Jansen engaged in all sorts of extravagant happenings, perhaps most famously in 1980 when he fashioned a 13-foot-diameter lightweight lens-shaped helium-filled U.F.O., complete with dangling spooky-sound emitter, which he and a group of friends released into the skies over Delft one blustery afternoon, provoking an immensely satisfying ‘'War of the Worlds''-like panic. After that, he was ruined for any conventional painterly practice. The following year, he built a massive inkjet printer, or rather a paint-jet scanner-printer, that captured and rendered a wall-size version of whatever object you put in front of it.By the mid-1980s, Jansen was also contributing a column every two weeks to the Dutch national newspaper De Volkskrant, or The People’s Newspaper, where he began hazarding all sorts of variously inspired (and sometimes cockamamie) schemes, like, for example, a new method for televising soccer matches (with the ball digitally fixed, continuously steady, at the very center of the screen as play, the players and the field swirled wildly about it); a new feature for passenger-jet flight, with the nose of the plane chopped clean off and the space immediately behind it converted into an observation deck, approachable through an airlock and entirely open to the elements (Jansen remains convinced and could almost convince you that the various air pressures would even out); and, another time, an arrangement of six mechanical plug-in timers, piggybacked in a way, one upon the next, that the outermost one could be counted on to sound off once every 23 million years (you never knew when such a thing might come in handy).And then one day, several years into this journalistic dalliance — on Feb. 24, 1990, to be precise — Jansen took note (quite early note at that) of the fact that the seas seemed to be rising, the high tides registering ever higher up the beaches with each passing season, a development, he pointed out, that ought to be of considerable concern to his fellow Netherlanders, citizens, after all, of the Low Countries, territories much of which famously lie beneath sea level. But not to worry, for here, too, Jansen had a plan. After all, he suggested, wasn’t the problem simply one of finding a way of transferring sand grains from the bottom of the beach up to the top, in the form of giant, continuously maintained protective dunes. If that was all there was to it, why not just invent a race of wind-powered beach creatures — strandbeests, as he dubbed them — veritable herds of them, that could merrily perform the task in perpetuity. In fact, he informed his readers, he already had two prototypes firmly in mind, and he was planning to take the coming summer to build the things, so they could be placed onto the coast in time for the first autumn storms. ‘'Perhaps,'’ he concluded by way of blithe surmise, ‘'the Dutch coast will look quite different in a year’s time.'’‘'I suppose I was a little overoptimistic back then,'’ Jansen admitted to me one afternoon as we sat in the cluttered study of his Delft homestead. ‘'I fancied myself becoming a hero by saving the entire country, like that proverbial boy with his — do you also have this expression in English? — his digit in the dam wall.'’The boy with his finger in the dike. Though, over the months of our get-togethers, I came to think of Jansen as something more like a cross between Leonardo da Vinci and Don Quixote (with maybe a smidgen of Sisyphus thrown in for good measure). Da Vinci for the wide-ranging ambition and sheer protean inventiveness — his avid facility at drawing, his leapfrogging, scientific bent of mind (da Vinci too had been fascinated by the prospects for free-coursing hydraulics and self-propelled machines). And Don Quixote for the sheer over-the-top ambition and vision and knight-errant nobility of the project, for, if the strandbeests weren’t a case of dreaming the impossible dream and tilting at windmills, I don’t know what is, except that in Jansen’s case, what he seemed intent on doing, if anything, was tilting and torquing windmills into veritable beasts of burden.Jansen told me that he had actually been thinking about the fundaments of life for several years before he proposed the strandbeests, ever since reading ‘'The Blind Watchmaker,'’ the 1986 best seller by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. ‘'That book had an enormous impact on me.'’The next few minutes were given over to a passionate disquisition on stick insects. In the distant past, Jansen said, channeling Dawkins, there were nakedly vulnerable insects and dim-sighted birds, but over time some of those insects, through random, accidental mutation, began looking more and more like sticks, while to counter this tendency, their bird predators (again through random, accidental mutation) developed progressively sharper vision. The two creatures, as it were, created each other. Jansen, in thrall to this notion, went on to create a sort of primitive protocreature of his own on his primordial Atari computer, a creature that consisted of just four abutting line segments. Across a near endless sequence of ‘'generations,'’ spread over a long night of machine-generated-and-evaluated permutations, the creatures grew ever more sly and cleverly adaptive. After that Jansen began trying to model the mystery of walking by deploying stick figures in a similar fashion. ‘'In its essence,'’ he said, ‘'walking is simply constantly changing your shape in such a way that you move forward. But how exactly does it work?'’And it was in the midst of those cogitations that, as Jansen himself was walking along the Scheveningen shore one day, the thought entered his head that maybe he ‘'should pay a visit to the Gamma hardware store and check out their plastic tubing.'’ He bought a length of standard PVC pipe (the kind that surrounds cable and electrical conduits) and took it back to his studio. And it was around that same time that he experienced his finger-in-the-dike epiphany, going on to publish that seminal strandbeest proposal.He told me how his first experiments, in the early ’90s, were ‘'sad, pathetic, really hopeless'’ affairs (‘'I was so naïve'’). He used tape to connect the PVC rods, but the creatures kept tearing and collapsing from their own weight; nor did he seem able to get them to walk properly. He advanced from tape to tie-cords, and that was somewhat better, though the walking mechanism was still all wrong. He was lost in a maze of sines and cosines, mapping out legs with two separate cranks, one for the upper limb and one for the lower, differing in phase by 90 degrees. The breakthrough, or rather two major breakthroughs, occurred on a single night, at the end of 1991. First he realized that the leg could have a far simpler structure if a single crank were moved up to the hip joint. (He proceeded to demonstrate all this for me on a plywood-board model he often takes to classes and lectures.) The leg itself would need to be fashioned out of 13 rods, pivoting in relation to one another, so that everything would depend on the specific ratio of the lengths of the 13 segments, one to another. The goal would be to create a long, slow stride with gentle curves planting the leg onto the ground and then pulling it up in order to quickly bring it back to the front of the next long stride.But how to determine those ratios? There were millions, probably billions, of possible combinations of the 13 figures, and even a computer working its way through all of them in brute sequence, especially in those days, would most likely take centuries to evaluate them all. But — and here came his second breakthrough of the night, a reversion to his Dawkins ideal — what if, once again drawing on those earlier experiments, he were instead to program an algorithm whereby thousands of sets of ratios could randomly compete against one another, the best virtual performers advancing forward as the basis for a new generation, generation after generation, until the algorithm itself naturally brought forth the best solution? He tried it, and his Atari chugged away literally for months, but eventually he had the magic ratios, 13 specific numbers (a=38, b=41.5, c=39.3, d=40.1, e=55.8, and so forth) that were to form the proportional basis for all the walking beasts that followed.The point was — and Jansen grew quite adamant about this — he never modeled his beests’ walk on that of any naturally occurring creatures (specific insects or striding mammals of any given sort); rather, he generated his ratios in much the same way that nature itself had most likely done so, natural history understood in this context as a vast sort of calculating algorithm, with evolution unfurling over eons of time through the marvels of natural selection. No wonder, though, that his creatures began evincing their uncannily ‘'lifelike'’ gait.In part for stability’s sake, Jansen said, the creatures evolved to become wider, with an extended array of legs striding along side by side, their peristaltic rhythm enforced by a long zigzag PVC crankshaft churning parallel to the ground the entire width of the striding beast, functioning as a sort of spinal or vertebral cord. If the creatures were to be self-sufficient, he reasoned, they would need to be able to gather in their own nutrition, or energy source, which in their case would consist of the wind: Wind would power the rotating spinal crankshaft, giving the creatures the wherewithal to move forward. So he began experimenting with different configurations of ever more elaborately counterbalanced sails.But what if there was no wind? The beests would need somehow to absorb and contain earlier wind energy for future use, and he came up with the notion of the striding beests compressing and storing air into empty plastic water bottles spread in rows along the creatures’ flanks, air which could in turn flow out at times of windlessness to churn the spinal crankshaft and power the legs: lungs, as it were, or, perhaps more accurately, ‘'air stomachs,'’ as he took to thinking of them, or maybe body fat. The beests had a tendency to march willy-nilly, often (and quite catastrophically) directly into the sea, so he had to concoct a way for the creatures to sense that they were approaching water (an empty rubber surgical tube dangling from their sides, which could register, in simple binary fashion, if the free passage of air were or were not starting to be occluded by water) — ‘'nerves,'’ as he defined the dangling tubes, which could in turn trip a series of ‘'muscles'’ (a muscle, in Jansen’s conception, being nothing more than ‘'an object which can grow longer or shorter on command,'’ and which he in turn created by having an inner rod slip pistonlike in and out of an outer sleeve), which, when activated, could redirect the errantly striding beest to reverse course.Jansen set himself the arbitrary (though to him quite obvious and incontrovertible) rule that he would not deploy any materials beyond PVC, rubber tubing, Dacron sails, plastic bottles, string or cord-ties, and the like: no electronic timers or counters or engines — his was a sensibility pitched to a preference for the resolutely material in the face of the ever more relentlessly virtual. Everything had to be reconceived in terms of PVC, but that became possible when he understood that any given tube could be open or closed (bent or straightened). Considered as such, as an ever more ingenious compounding sequence of binary nerve sensors that would function like logic gates or step counters, the system as a whole could begin to be seen, for all intents and purposes, as having a ‘'brain.'’As the years passed, Jansen took to granting succeeding generations of his strandbeests elaborate Linnaean names: Animaris Vulgaris, A. Speculator, A. Currens Ventosa, A. Sabulosa Adolescens, A. Vaporis. Not that progress was in any way direct or simple. Jansen was growing less and less interested in the seemingly ever more distant goal of sand-shifting and dike-plugging and more and more captivated by the sheer marvel of the immediate evolutionary process playing out before him. There were countless dead ends and haphazard detours. (‘'As how wouldn’t there be,'’ he once asked me, ‘'random mistakes and mutations being the very engine of evolution?'’) Some of them proved quite harrowing. ‘'Until I came up with the expedient of sealant and O-rings,'’ he told me at one point, ‘'the tube muscles exhibited all sorts of leakage and squishing, along with the occasional stray piston exploding out right past my head.'’ He laughed. ‘'Making life, let me tell you, is fraught with danger.'’ Nor is it necessarily a pretty sight. ‘'There was one occasion,'’ he said a few minutes later, ‘'when the wind picked up and a whole herd of Animari Genetici — the Genetici were the first to deploy in herds — all began rolling across the beach, sometimes rising and bouncing and tossing meters into the air, like so many tumbleweeds.'’ His eyes widened at the memory: ‘'One has to admit, it was a marvelous sight.'’ He took to video-recording his beests as they paraded down the beach, often for minutes and hundreds of yards at a time, though sometimes the magnificently striding creatures would only barely make it out of the camera’s frame before they tripped over themselves and crumpled ignominiously.The calibrations and recalibrations took years, across generation after generation of new beest types and fresh experiments at the shore. ‘'People talk about how beautiful my strandbeests are as they parade down the beach,'’ he said. ‘'But you have to understand: I was never interested in beauty as such. I was interested in survival, so everything was based on a consideration of function, how to make the things function better. The fascinating thing, though, was that — here again, as with nature — the better the functioning, often, the more beautiful the result.‘'Right now the big task is still to fit the beests for sheer survival,'’ Jansen added. ‘'If they are ever going to reproduce on their own, they are first going to have to be able to survive those autumn squalls.'’ For a while he’d been trying to contrive a barometric system whereby the beests could sense oncoming storms, readjust their positions, snout facing into the approaching front, then hammer an anchoring spike into the sand, but that system proved too unwieldy. He was also working on an elaborate system of counterpoised pistons that allowed beests to reverse their course, should they approach either the sea on one side or the ‘'too fluffy'’ dry sand on the other, but that, too, was proving too heavy. So, mind-doodling, he came up with an alternative scheme (flying buttress exoskeletons) that he is eager to refine next summer. Jansen patted the snout of one beest with fatherly pride, breaking into another smile. ‘'I really think we’re going to make it, though,'’ he said. ‘'We’re almost there. All I need is another 20 years.'’The thing of it is, as I increasingly came to feel whenever Jansen would take one of his creatures out for a stroll, they really do appear to be alive. Purposeful, resolute, canny. They don’t fall into the uncanny valley that famously afflicts so many other robotic assaults on the absolutely lifelike, perhaps because they aren’t trying to seem anything other than what they are: They are self-evidently PVC machines, and yet, in their steady animation, they almost seem to evince a soul. Ordinarily we think of the face as the locus of the soul, but our sense of soulfulness, especially when experienced from afar, equally lodges in a creature’s gait, its stride, its posture in motion — the very word animation, after all, deriving from the Latin anima. All of this provokes a sense of fellow feeling: That entity over there is also alive, just like us. Robots have famously lacked it (by contrast seeming hesitant and herky-jerky), people with Parkinson’s disease sometimes feel themselves losing it (they bemoan the loss as one of the most horrible existential side effects of the condition), but these strandbeests are full of it. When we say, speaking of life, which is otherwise famously difficult to define, that we know it when we see it, are we perhaps acknowledging that there is a specifically aesthetic component to that recognition? Watching the strandbeests breasting forward in full stride, we can’t help ourselves: Our hearts become lodged in our mouths.But does that say something about them or about us? One time, as one beest, winded, slowly wound down to a stop, I asked Jansen that other version of the question that had been haunting me all along. ‘'Oh,'’ he responded, without a moment’s hesitation. ‘'It is obviously them: They are very much alive.'’ You never quite know what to make of Jansen at moments like this: He never breaks character, though, and he honestly seems to believe what he’s saying. For starters, he argues, following his man Dawkins, we should stop thinking of life solely in terms of genes; ‘'memes'’ (cultural tropes) constitute every bit as profoundly a form of life. Everything, all life, is information, is code multiplying itself. Thus, one day, Jansen was telling me that his strandbeests were already propagating themselves exponentially all over the world — not only because he had posted his famous ratios as open code for anyone else to use (‘'And you wouldn’t believe the sorts of things people are coming up with,'’ he says, with thoroughgoing relish, ‘'often more marvelous and inventive than any of my own efforts'’ — not to mention all the crossover model kits and 3-D printed versions, both licensed and unlicensed, that have begun popping up all over the place), but also because his beests had begun appearing in ads and videos. In one ad, in which Jansen served as a paid spokesman for BMW, he was heard to proclaim, in true Renaissance fashion, that ‘'the walls between art and engineering exist only in our minds.'’ Likewise, perhaps, you were given to grumble, those between art and commerce — although Jansen’s continuing development of the strandbeests was now being supported to no small extent by these sorts of commercial endorsements. The point for Jansen, though, was that every individual who saw these images had in a certain sense taken their memetic material into their own life, and the beests thus began partaking of life in the form of lived ideas.Seeing that I was a bit dubious about this last near-ontological vault, Jansen challenged me to ‘'imagine a wooden machine that would go into the forest to chop wood to make a machine that would go into a forest to chop wood.'’ O.K., I responded, warily. Well, he said, such a machine already exists. Yeah, I responded, if ideas ‘'exist,'’ then I suppose this one does, too. But no, he insisted, this one really does, whereupon he went on to describe a chain letter, which if you think about it (or such anyway is the way he thinks about it) is nothing other than paper (pulped wood) reproducing itself in exponential fashion. If you (or anyway, I) ever so tentatively objected that, actually no, wouldn’t such chain letters merely constitute a case of human beings performing a compounding action (and of course human beings are alive, nobody has argued against that), Jansen would be likely to object, as he did the day we were talking about all of this, in a dialectical ecstasy all his own, that yours (mine, ours) was merely a case of unsustainable (albeit persistent) anthropocentrism. ‘'Stop always putting yourself, in your role as human being, at the center of everything,'’ he said. ‘'Look at things, in this instance, from the point of view of the sheet of paper, for whom human beings are merely a vehicle for their ongoing propagation.'’Jansen was quiet for a moment, seemingly lost in thought, and then resumed all the more vehemently: ‘'Plastic PVC tubes entered my life one fine September day in 1990, and since then, the strandbeests have ruled my life. They’ve become an addiction, a disease, a virus if you like. A virus that has commandeered and refuses to leave my body. I am their victim: The strandbeests are forcing me to make them.'’But wait, I countered, wasn’t he, if anything, their god? ‘'It is true,'’ Jansen replied, ‘'that up till now they do require my ministrations to help them realize their destiny. But no, I am not their god. I am their slave.'’Evenings, back at my hotel along the Scheveningen coast, I had been doing a lot of reading. For example, Elisabeth Kolbert’s ‘'The Sixth Extinction,'’ a brave and fierce meditation on the history of life on Earth and the eradication of most of the great variety of animals that once lived here. At one point, she was describing how, during the last mass extinction, the fifth one, when that asteroid plowed into the Yucatán, provoking the sudden, almost overnight, dying off of the dinosaurs, only a few, nondiverse species survived through into the next life epoch. Now we are seeing a similar extinction, and what will most likely survive will be the so-called ‘'weed'’ creatures — rats, squirrels, cockroaches and, well, at least this far, humans. And, I found myself wondering, plastic?But then, the question kept nagging: could mere plastic ever even rise to the level of weeds? The eminent science-fiction writer and futurologist Arthur C. Clarke was adamant throughout his life in his conviction that tools invented man (literally expanded the Cro-Magnon brain), who in turn invented more complex tools, and so forth, in an ever-compounding synergistic upward spiral, each side bringing out ever greater sophistications in the other till one day soon, Clarke was convinced (and was quite unsettlingly pleased, at that, in his conviction) our tools will replace us entirely. ‘'We need look no further for the famous ‘missing link,' '’ Clarke argued, ecstatic, near the very end of his life, ‘'it is us. As Nietzsche said, ‘Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the superhuman — a rope across the abyss.' '’Looking at such questions from the far other side of the matter, the neurologist Oliver Sacks, writing in a recent issue of The New York Review of Books that I happened to have with me, noted how the extraordinarily simple jellyfish nervous system nonetheless ‘'has every right to be considered a brain, generating, as it does, complex adaptive behaviors. . . . Whether we can speak of a ‘mind’ here (as Darwin does in regard to earthworms) depends on how one defines ‘mind.' '’Turning from there to the question of how you define ‘'life,'’ an associate editor at Scientific American, Ferris Jabr, writing on this paper’s opinion pages not long ago (I had brought the clipping with me), used Jansen’s own case as an occasion to contend that ‘'strandbeests are no more or less alive than animals, fungi and plants.'’ In fact, nothing, he went on to insist, is truly alive. (Nor is anything else entirely nonliving.) ‘'Some things we regard as inanimate are capable of some of the processes we want to make exclusive to life. And some things we say are alive get along just fine without some of those processes.'’ In particular, Jabr pointed to how viruses, non-self-sustaining bits ‘'of DNA or RNA encased in a protein,'’ while capable of incredibly efficient reproduction and evolution, can only do so by introjecting themselves into a living cell and ‘'hijacking'’ its capacities. ‘'We have insisted that all matter naturally segregates into two categories — life and nonlife — [but] have searched in vain for the dividing line.'’ The reason being that it’s not there. Life, he goes on to suggest, is a concept, a useful concept (it is in our heads, and perhaps can’t help but be), ‘'but it does not reflect the reality of the universe outside the mind.'’Which in turn reminded me of the famous passage in Ludwig Wittgenstein’s ‘'Philosophical Investigations,'’ which I then tracked down over the web, where Wittgenstein has been yammering on about ‘'language games'’ for some time and then entertains a possible objection that he has not yet specified what he means by ‘'game.'’ Whereupon he begins a fairly exhaustive taxonomical exposition, trying to establish what might apply in common to, say, ‘'board games, card games, Olympic Games and so on,'’ moving past tick-tack-toe and chess and beyond, eventually arriving at the conclusion that there are no properties common to all of them, that rather, at best, they evince a network of ‘'family resemblances.'’ At which point, Wittgenstein suggests that were he presented with one final supposed objection, that there is after all ‘'something common to all these constructions — namely the disjunction of all their common properties,'’ he would counter: ‘'Now you are only playing with words.'’Which, when you think about it, is a really funny answer, because what is philosophical playing but another sort of game?My last evening in the Netherlands, I found myself reading the art critic Lawrence Gowing on Vermeer, a resident of Delft like Jansen, where I came upon the passage in which Gowing describes Vermeer’s achievement as ‘'a slender and perfect plume thrown up by the wave of Dutch painting at its crest.'’And turning out the light, drifting off to sleep, I couldn’t help thinking of Jansen and his project, of digits and dikes, of life and extinction, and the rich imponderabilities, 23 million years on out, of what just might survive and what just might persist.The next afternoon, as we trudged back up the hill to fetch the last beest segment, Jansen was talking about the Ypenburg housing development down below, how this area right here, six miles from the current shore, must have once constituted the coastline, because when they were excavating the township’s shopping center, they came upon a whole graveyard, not just a single skeleton, that was nearly 6,000 years old — fishermen mostly, but also a mother with her newborn child in her arms, something like 41 separate skeletons. ‘'Of course,'’ Jansen commented, ‘'organic material eventually decomposes, but plastic'’ — he reached for the next segment — ‘'plastic is forever.'’Would the strandbeests outlast Jansen? More to the point, could they at some point keep evolving on their own? ‘'It ought to be possible,'’ Jansen assured me. ‘'It’s all a question of information, of code, of better and better code: the proper extension of muscles, better ways of striding forward or sensing danger. And I’ve been working out methods in my head, a sort of plug-and-socket configuration whereby the beests could transfer such genetic information by way of a long tube of memory laid out in binary format, inserted from one into the other, in such a way that it could then readjust ratios of one sort or another in the recipient.'’ Here he paused, briefly. ‘'I’m not suggesting it wouldn’t be tricky. First of all, of course, a beest would have to be able to find and latch on to another of its own kind, then the two of them would have to decide which of them was the dominant, which they should be able to do by comparing their respective counter-recorders, and then the dominant would somehow need to insert his code — the information itself, not any sort of material packet — into the other.'’ Another pause. ‘'Of course there would be mistakes over the passage of time, but mistakes are a crucial part of evolution. The point is that over time, the herd would keep improving or at any rate rendering itself more fit to the changing environment, and doing so on its own.'’Jansen shifted the weight of his beest segment as he continued down the hill. ‘'Just another 20 years,'’ he reiterated. ‘'And the funny thing is, I’ve just given up my Delft apartment and am moving back to Scheveningen, to a glassed-in apartment six stories up, overlooking the beach, just a few hundred meters from where I grew up. I want to spend my last 20 years where I spent my first'’ — he grinned — ‘'ending up in diapers at the very place I began in diapers.'’ Maybe, I suggested, by then he would have come up with a beest for that sort of problem.We arrived at the container, and the crew lifted this last segment up into the crate and now finished strapping everything down tight. On cue, a Dutch customs official arrived in a little sedan; he got out, approached the container, peered in, reviewed Francesca’s carefully revisioned manifest, peered in again, shook his head. But after the crew closed and locked the container doors, he slid a thin metal thread between the latches so as to seal the package, and patted his approval along the flank of the cargo hold.The driver revved up the engine, and off the flatbed went, coursing toward the harbor, veritably teeming with its lively cargo of strandbeests lumbering toward Miami Beach to be born."
